For this work,he received the Nobel Prize for physiology ormedicine in 1930. In 1936 he wrote Serological Reactions,  establish the science of immunochemistry. In 1940 hediscovered the Rh factor, the protein on the surface ofred blood cells that determines if the blood type ispositive (Rh-positive) or negative (Rh-negative). If themother has a negative Rh factor (Rh-negative) and thefather and fetus are Rh-positive, the mother canbecome Rh-sensitized and produce antibodies to com-bat fetal blood cells that cross the placenta into herbloodstream. These antibodies can destroy the fetus\u2019sRh-positive blood cells, putting it at serious risk ofanemia.In 1939 he became emeritus professor at the Rock-efeller Institute.

    "abscisic acid (ABA)": " A plant hormone (C15H20O4)and weak acid that generally acts to inhibit growth,induces dormancy, and helps the plant tolerate stressfulconditions by closing stomata. Abscisic acid wasnamed based on a belief that the hormone caused theabscission (shedding) of leaves from deciduous treesduring the fall.At times when a plant needs to slow down growthand assume a resting (dormant) stage, abscisic acid isproduced in the terminal bud, which slows downgrowth and directs the leaf primordia to develop scalesthat protect the dormant bud during winter. Becausethe hormone also inhibits cell division in the vascularcambium, both primary and secondary growth are puton hold during winter.This hormone also acts as a stress agent that helpsa plant deal with adverse conditions. For example,ABA accumulates on leaves and causes stomata toclose, reducing the loss of water when a plant begins towilt.In 1963, abscisic acid was first identified and char-acterized by Frederick Addicott and colleagues. In1965, the chemical structure of ABA was defined, andin 1967, it was formally called abscisic acid.",

Severalpopulations of the Karner blue butterfly are now sepa-rated from each other by human-made developmentand may be evolving into separate subspecies orspecies, even though geographically they are isolated byonly a few miles in some cases.Conditions that favor allopatric speciation arewhen one population becomes isolated at the fringe ofthe parent population\u2019s range. This splinter population,called a peripheral isolate, is likely to become allopatricbecause the gene pool of the isolate may already be dif-ferent, since living on the border of the range encour-ages the expression of the extremes of any genotypicCLINEs that existed in the original population. Further-more, if the population is small enough, a FOUNDEREFFECTwill occur, giving rise to a gene pool that is notthat of the parent population.Genetic drift will also occur until the peripheralisolate becomes a larger population and will continueto change the gene pool at random until the populationgrows.

For example, the Karner blue butterfly hasa row of orange spots on the top of the hindwing,whereas, the ancestral parent, the Melissa blue butter-fly, has orange spots on the top of both front and hind-wing, a phenotypic variation.Another factor in causing allopatric speciation isthat evolution via natural selection may take a differentroad in the peripheral population.

They do not ionize or participatein the formation of hydrogen bonds. On the otherhand, the hydrophilic or polar amino acids tend tointeract with the aqueous environment, are usuallyinvolved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, and areusually found on the exterior surfaces of proteins or intheir reactive centers. It is for this reason that certainamino acid R-groups allow enzyme reactions to occur.The ", 
    "alternation of generations": " A life cycle in plantswhere there is both a multicellular diploid form (thesporophyte generation) and a multicellular haploidform (the gametophyte generation).Gametophytes produce haploid gametes that fusezygotes that are forming. These zygotes then developinto diploid sporophytes. Meiosis in the sporophytesproduces haploid spores, with division by meiosis giv-ing rise to the next generation of gametophytes.Alternation of generations occurs in plants and cer-tain species of ALGAE. Ferns and fern allies (such as theclub moss) are common examples that display alterna-tion of generations. The above ground parent fernplant (the diploid sporophyte, or spore-bearing plant)has two full sets of chromosomes (two of each kind ofchromosome). It sheds its single-celled haploid spores,having one set of chromosomes (one of each kind),which fall to the ground, and these in turn grow into adifferent plant, the gametophyte or prothallus, alsohaploid. The gametophyte has special bodies within theplant called archegonia (female cells) and antheridia(male cells). Here sexual fertilization takes place, and anew diploid sporophyte then grows.There are four main groups of plants considered tobe \u201cfern allies,\u201d a diverse group of vascular plants thatare neither flowering plants nor ",

The residue that has a free carboxy group,or at least does not acylate another amino acid residue (it may, for example, acylate ammonia to give\u2013NH\u2013CHR\u2013CO\u2013NH2), is called C-terminal.The following is a list of symbols for amino acids(use of the one-letter symbols should be restricted tothe comparison of long sequences):aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) When ribo-somes pair a tRNA (transfer ribonucleic acid) with acodon (three bases in a DNA or RNA sequence), anamino acid is expected to be carried by the tRNA.Since each tRNA is matched with its amino acidbefore it meets the ribosome, the ribosome has noway of knowing if the match was made. The match ismade by a family of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases. These enzymes charge each tRNA withthe proper amino acid via a covalent ester bond,allowing each tRNA to make the proper translationfrom the genetic code of DNA into the amino acidcode of proteins. Cells make at least 20 differentaminoacyl-tRNS synthetases, one for each of theamino acids.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases belong to twoclasses, depending on which amino acid they specify.Class I enzymes usually are monomeric and attach tothe carobxyl of their specific amino acid to the 2\u2019 OHof adenosine 76 in the tRNA molecule. Class IIenzymes are either dimeric or tetrameric and attachto their amino acids at the 3\u2019 OH. These enzymes catalyze first by activating the amino acid by formingan aminoacyl-adenylate. Here the carboxyl of theamino acid is linked to the alpha-phosphate of ATP,displacing pyrophosphate. After the corrected tRNAis bound, the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate is transferred to the 2\u2019 or 3\u2019 terminal OHof the tRNA.Recent studies have shown that aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases can tell the difference between the right andthe wrong tRNA before they ever start catalysis, and ifthe enzyme binds aminoacyl-adenylate first, it is evenmore specific during tRNA binding. Previous studieshave also proved that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetasesreject wrong tRNAs during catalysis. Other researchhas shown that specific aaRSs play roles in cellularfidelity, tRNA processing, RNA splicing, RNA traffick-ing, apoptosis, and transcriptional and translationalregulation. These new revelations may present newevolutionary models for the development of cells andperhaps opportunities for pharmaceutical advance-ments.amino group (\u2013NH 2 ) A functional group (group ofatoms within a molecule that is responsible for certainproperties of the molecule and reactions in which ittakes part), common to all amino acids, that consists ofa nitrogen atom bonded covalently to two hydrogenatoms, leaving a lone valence electron on the nitrogenatom capable of bonding to another atom. It can act asa base in solution by accepting a hydrogen ion and car-rying a charge of +1.

    "Arrhenius, Svante August": " (1859\u20131927) SwedishChemist, Physicist Svante August Arrhenius was bornin Vik (or Wijk), near Uppsala, Sweden, on February19, 1859. He was the second son of Svante GustavArrhenius and Carolina Christina (n\u00e9e Thunberg).Svante\u2019s father was a surveyor and an administrator ofhis family\u2019s estate at Vik. In 1860, a year after Arrhe-nius was born, his family moved to Uppsala, where hisfather became a supervisor at the university. He wasreading by the age of three.Arrhenius received his early education at thecathedral school in Uppsala, excelling in biology,physics, and mathematics. In 1876, he entered theUniversity of Uppsala and studied physics, chemistry,and mathematics, receiving his B.S. two years later.While he continued graduate classes for three years inphysics at Uppsala, his studies were not completedthere. Instead, Arrhenius transferred to the SwedishAcademy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1881 to workunder Erick Edlund to conduct research in the field ofelectrical theory.Arrhenius studied electrical conductivity of dilutesolutions by passing electric current through a varietyof solutions. His research determined that moleculesin some of the substances split apart, or dissociatedfrom each other, into two or more ions when theywere dissolved in a liquid. He found that while eachintact molecule was electrically balanced, the splitparticles carried a small positive or negative electricalcharge when dissolved in water. The charged atomspermitted the passage of electricity, and the electricalcurrent directed the active components toward theelectrodes. His thesis on the theory of ionic dissocia-tion was barely accepted by the University of Uppsalain 1884, since the faculty believed that oppositelycharged particles could not coexist in solution. Hereceived a grade that prohibited him from being ableto teach.Arrhenius published his theories (\u201cInvestigationson the Galvanic Conductivity of Electrolytes\u201d) andsent copies of his thesis to a number of leading Euro-pean scientists. Russian-German chemist Wilhelm Ost-wald, one of the leading European scientists of the dayand one of the principal founders of physical chem-istry, was impressed and visited him in Uppsala, offer-ing him a teaching position, which he declined.However, Ostwald\u2019s support was enough for Uppsalato give him a lecturing position, which he kept for twoyears.The Stockholm Academy of Sciences awardedArrhenius a traveling scholarship in 1886. As a result,he worked with Ostwald in Riga with physicistFriedrich Kohlrausch at the University of Wurzburg,with physicist Ludwig Boltzmann at the University ofGraz, and with chemist Jacobus Van\u2019t Hoff at the Uni-versity of Amsterdam. In 1889, he formulated his rateequation that is used for many chemical transforma-tions and processes, in which the rate is exponentiallyrelated to temperature, known as the \u201cArrheniusequation.\u201dHe returned to Stockholm in 1891 and became alecturer in physics at Stockholm\u2019s Hogskola (highschool) and was appointed physics professor in 1895and rector in 1897. Arrhenius married Sofia Rudbeckin 1894 and had one son. The marriage lasted a shorttwo years. Arrhenius continued his work on elec-trolytic dissociation and added the study of osmoticpressure.In 1896, he made the first quantitative linkbetween changes in carbon dioxide concentration andclimate. He calculated the absorption coefficients ofcarbon dioxide and water based on the emission spec-trum of the moon, and he also calculated the amountArrhenius, Svante August 27 ",

He like-wise believed that spores might have populated manyother planets, resulting in life throughout the universe.In 1902, he received the Davy Medal of the RoyalSociety and proposed a theory of immunology. The fol-lowing year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chem-istry for his work that originally had been perceived asimprobable by his Uppsala professors. He also pub-lished his He became director of the Nobel Institute of Physi-cal Chemistry in Stockholm in 1905 (a post he helduntil a few months before his death).

He was elected a foreign member of the RoyalSociety in 1911, the same year he received the WillardGibbs Medal of the American Chemical Society. Threeyears later he was awarded the Faraday Medal of theBritish Chemical Society. He was also a member of theSwedish Academy of Sciences and the German Chemi-cal Society.During the latter part of his life his interests includ-ed the chemistry of living matter and astrophysics, espe-cially the origins and fate of stars and planets.

Anotherchemical used for screening stains for blood is phenolph-thalein. Both tests consist of a two-step procedure. Thefirst step is to moisten a white filter paper with distilledwater. Apply the filter paper to the suspected bloodstain.A portion of the stain will transfer onto the moistenedpaper. Add the leucomalachite green reagent to thepaper. The second step is to add hydrogen peroxide to thefilter paper and look for a color change on the paper. Apositive result will yeild a bluish-green color. When phe-nolphthalein is mixed with a dried bloodstain, with theaddition of hydrogen peroxide, the hemoglobin in theblood causes the formation of a deep pink color. The leu-comalachite green test is a presumptive test for bloodthat is used by many laboratories today. The heme groupin hemoglobin catalyzes the oxidation by peroxide of themalachite green to produce a bluish-green reaction whenthe suspected stain is blood.Luminol is a chemical reagent that is very useful inlocating small traces of blood at a crime scene. Unlike theabove-mentioned chemical screening test, the reaction ofluminol with blood results in the production of light ratherthan color. The one requirement for the use of luminol isthat the scene be completely dark. Luminol is a chemicalthat can be used as a spray at crime scenes and will reactwith any blood present, causing a luminescence.The second step in blood identification is the use ofconfirmatory tests.

In this test, which detects antibodies indried bloodstains, two portions of the stains are placed ontomicroscope slides. Type A red cells are added to one glassslide, and Type B red cells to the other slide. If the blood-stain on the slide contains anti-A antibodies, the A red cellsthat were added will agglutinate, which looks likecrosslinked cells under the microscope. Agglutination of theA cells indicates that anti-A is present, and therefore, thatthe bloodstain is of blood group B.The other approach to typing dried bloodstains is thedetection of the antigens that are on the surface of the redblood cells. When blood dries, the red cells break apart, butthe red blood cell antigens are still present in the dried stains.The two major methods that have been used are absorption-inhibition and absorption-elution.

PCR has revolutionizedthe approach to the recovery of DNA from a variety ofsources. Availability of oligonucleotide primers is the key tothe amplification process. PCR consists of three steps,beginning with the denaturing of the double-strand DNA,separated by heating to 90\u201396\u00b0C.

The number of repeats at an STRlocus can be highly variable among individuals, resulting indifferent-length polymorphisms that can be detected byrelatively simple use of the PCR-based assays. STR loci areuseful to forensic science because of their small range ofalleles, their high sensitivity, and suitability even if the DNAis degraded. Today the forensic laboratory using thePCR/STR analysis can individualize bloodstains obtainedfrom forensic evidence with a very high probability of iden-tifying a single individual.In the past, forensic scientists who handled biologicalforensic evidence were only able to tell the investigatingofficial whether the dried stain at the crime scene wasblood. Today the forensic laboratory reports contain informa-tion about dried stains at crime scenes that can be related toone individual. This information has been tremendously help-ful in the investigation of crimes. With the establishment of aDNA database, physical evidence collected from the crimescene that contains biological stains can be analyzed evenif there is no suspect. The DNA profile developed fromforensic bloodstain evidence can be compared with variousDNA databases to develop a match, which could lead toidentification of an individual.\u2014John C.

He worked as prosector at theLyons Hospital and taught anatomy and operativesurgery at the university. By 1906, he was at the Rocke-feller Institute for Medical Research, where he carriedout most of his landmark experiments.Influenced by the assassination by knife of the pres-ident of France in 1894, he dedicated himself to developa way to suture blood vessels, which ironically he devel-oped after he studied with a French embroidress whoshowed him how to do embroidery. His first attemptwas made in France in 1902. He subsequently devel-oped the triangulation technique of vascular suture.

Autosomal chromosome abnormali-ties generally have more serious consequences than sexchromosome abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities area major cause of fetal loss. These numbers decrease bybirth, and since some trisomies result in early death, theirfrequency is lower in children and even lower in adults. Numerical changes are the most common chromo-some abnormalities. Most numerical changes are the resultof nondisjunction in the first meiotic division. Mitoticnondisjunction typically results in mosaicism. Chromosomestructural changes can be balanced or unbalanced.

Today, we know that both continentsand ocean floor float as solid plates on underlying rockthat behaves like a viscous fluid due to being undersuch tremendous heat and pressure.

    "Florentine thermometers": ", or anythermometers of the time, were not very accurate; notwo thermometers gave the same temperature, sincethere was no universal acceptance of liquid type oragreement on what to use for a scale. Makers of Flo-rentine thermometers marked the low end of the scaleas the coldest day in Florence that year and the highend of the scale as the hottest day. Because tempera-ture fluctuations naturally occur over the years, notwo thermometers gave the same temperature. For sev-eral years Fahrenheit experimented with this problem,finally devising an accurate alcohol thermometer in1709 and the first mercury or \u201cquicksilver\u201d ther-mometer in 1714.Fahrenheit\u2019s first thermometers, from about 1709 to1715, contained a column of alcohol that directlyexpanded and contracted, based on a design made byDanish astronomer Olaus Romer in 1708, which Fahren-heit personally reviewed. Romer used alcohol (actuallywine) as the liquid, but his thermometer had two fixedreference points. He selected 60 degrees for the tempera-ture of boiling water and 7.5 degrees for melting ice.Fahrenheit eventually devised a temperature scalefor his alcohol thermometers with three points calibratedat 32 degrees for freezing water, 96 degrees for bodytemperature (based on the thermometer being in ahealthy man\u2019s mouth or under the armpit), and zerodegrees fixed at the freezing point of ice and salt,believed at the time to be the coldest possible tempera-ture. The scale was etched in 12 major points (with zero,four, and 12 as three points) and eight gradationsbetween the major points, giving him a total of 96 pointsfor his scale for body temperature on his thermometer.Because his thermometers showed such consistencyin their measurements, mathematician Christian Wolfat Halle, Prussia, devoted a whole paper in an editionof  national journals of the time, on two of Fahrenheit\u2019sthermometers that were given to him in 1714. From1682 until it ceased publication in 1731, the Latin Eruditorum,  ported by the duke of Saxony, was one of the mostimportant international journals. The periodical wasfounded by Otto Mencke, professor of morals andpractical philosophy, and mathematician Gottfried Wil-helm Leibnitz. Written in Latin, the journal covered sci-ence and social science and was primarily a vehicle forreviewing books. In 1724 Fahrenheit published a paper,\u201cExperimenta circa gradum caloris liquorum nonnullo-rum ebullientium instituta (Experiments done on thedegree of heat of a few boiling liquids), in the RoyalSociety\u2019s publication was admitted to the Royal Society the same year.Fahrenheit decided to substitute mercury for thealcohol because its rate of expansion was more con-stant than that of alcohol and could be used over awider range of temperatures.

The level at which the various ladybugscompete is not that well understood. The nine-spotted andthe seven-spotted are very close relatives, so the fact thatthey compete directly should not have surprised scientists.What is more surprising is that the distantly related Asianladybug displaced the nine-spotted and many others,despite the lack of any close relationship. Parasites anddiseases of introduced insects are some of the baggagethat comes with these introductions. The introductionshave evolved a resistance or at least a tolerance to thesecoevolved agents to which our native species have neverbeen exposed. It is smallpox at an insect level.All the aforementioned ladybugs eat aphids, but theycan be particular about which species and in what habitats.The diversity of native ladybug species was achievedthrough natural selection.

This was achieved with a curved metal hook,which was inserted through the nose. The metal could easi-ly fracture the thin ethmoid bone and enter the skull. Thecurved hook was twisted repeatedly to macerate the brain,which was removed piecemeal through the nose.According to Herodotus, \u201cThe skull is cleared of therest by rinsing with drugs; next they make a cut along theflank with a sharp Ethiopian stone and take out the wholecontents of the abdomen, which they then cleanse, washingit thoroughly with palm wine, and again frequently with aninfusion of pounded aromatics. After this they fill the cavitywith the purest bruised myrrh, with cassia, and every sort ofspice except frankincense, and sew up the opening.

After the expiration of this space of time, whichmust not be exceeded, the body is washed, and wrappedround, from head to foot, with bandages of fine linen cloth,smeared over with gum, which is used generally by theEgyptians in the place of glue, and in this state it is givenback to the relations, who enclose it in a wooden casewhich they have made for this purpose, and shaped into thefigure of a man.

He neverreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree, was nominated for theM.A. in 1663 by Lord Clarendon, the chan", 
    "Royal Society of London": ".The society, also known as The Royal Society of Lon-don for Improving Natural Knowledge, was foundedon November 28, 1660, to discuss the latest develop-ments in science, philosophy, and the arts. The found-ing fathers, consisting of 12 men, began after a lectureby Christopher Wren at Gresham College. The groupincluded Wren, Boyle, John Wilkins, Sir Robert Moray,and William Brouncker. This position gave Hooke aunique opportunity to familiarize himself with the lat-est progress in science.Part of Hooke\u2019s job was to demonstrate and lectureon several experiments at the Royal Society at eachweekly meeting. This led him to many observationsand inventions in a number of fields, including astrono-my, physics, and meteorology. He excelled at this job,and in 1663 Hooke was elected a fellow of the society,becoming not just an employee but on equal footingwith the other members.Hooke took advantage of his experience and posi-tion. He invented the first reflecting telescope, the spi-ral spring in watches, an iris diaphragm for telescopes(now used in cameras instead), the universal joint, thefirst screw-divided quadrant, a compound microscope,an odometer, a wheel-cutting machine, a hearing aid, anew type of glass, and carriage improvements. Despiteall of these accomplishments, he remains one of themost neglected scientists, due to his argumentative styleand the apparent retribution by his enemies such asNewton.Hooke became a professor of physics at GreshamCollege in 1665 and stayed there for his entire life. Itwas also where the Royal Society met until after hisdeath. Hooke also served as the society\u2019s secretary from1677 to 1683.The year 1665 is another milestone year forHooke, since that is when he published his major workMicrographia,  where he demonstrated his remarkable powers ofobservation and his skillful microscopic investigation inthe fields of botany, chemistry, and meteorology. With-in this work, he made many acute observations, illus-trated with intricate drawings, and proposed severaltheories.Hooke was the first to discover plant cells and hecoined the word structure of cork, although he failed to realize that cellswere the basic units of life. He made detailed observa-tions, some of the first, on insects, sponges, bryozoans,foraminifera, and even birds. He was the first to exam-ine fossils under a microscope and concluded thatmany fossils represented organisms that no longerexisted on Earth.Because of his controversies\u2014he had competingclaims with Christian Huyghens over the invention ofthe spring regulator and with Newton, first over optics(1672) and, second, over the formulation of the inversesquare law of gravitation (1686)\u2014Hooke fell out offavor in the scientific community.

An exampleof this is the scientist who stated that she would considerthe possible existence of a soul\u2014as soon as they deter-mined the part of the brain that provided communicationwith the soul.Most people believe that they have a soul and con-sider the issues of life after death, the existence andnature of God, and the meaning of life. Religious beliefsand values enable them to relate to the unknown with ben-efit to their personal values, conduct, and happiness.However, most scientists by their indifference and skepti-cism have tended to undermine the value of faith and treatit as superstition.In these matters, hypotheses that cannot be proved ordisproved should be judged, or at least acknowledged ofvalue, by the results in the lives of individuals who practicetheir faith.The one belief that science has mathematically provedis the existence and benefit of love. (See Von Foerster,Heinz.  Representation.  Love can thus provide the test of hypotheses about phe-nomena of mind and spirit that presently defy explanation.So now ultimate questions about reality, which remain pro-found mysteries that cannot be approached by scientificmeasurements or methods, can nevertheless be recognizedand pursued through articles of faith and practice. If realityis consistent, then the truth and the value of a faith or beliefcan be judged by the increase and depth of love\u2014or cre-ative altruism\u2014in the lives of those who practice at belief.Prayer to a personal God and practice of the Sermonon the Mount has inspired personal love and courage andled to great peaceful changes for social freedom and jus-tice. (See and Science must no longer negate the values of religiousbelief, but rather strengthen and support the importance offaith\u2014of using the personal metaphor that increases thewell-being of the individual, that deepens relationships withpeople and kinship with life on Earth.The scientific approach can at the same time dimin-ish religious intolerance by calling attention to the natureof metaphor or hypothesis. A hypothesis can be excitingand useful and obtain confidence from its supporters whomay totally believe in its validity. Nevertheless, by itsnature there must be, and can be, recognition and respectfor people with a different hypothesis about reality. Whereapproval for a different religious or philosophical doctrinemay be impossible, there still can be deep approval of thelove that is motivated and demonstrated in connectionwith it.The scientific community should also give importanceto any phenomenon that greatly affects human values andpotentials, even though scientific explanation eludes itsgrasp. There is overwhelming evidence of answered prayerin the lives of many people. The incidence of favorable coin-cidence in deeply dedicated people who pray with fervorand faith should be studied and compared with other peoplewho practice a purely psychological approach to needs.The nature and extent of coincidences that run contrary toprobability theory should be more thoroughly explored. Per-haps there is no satisfactory explanation possible. But thisshould not cause science to ignore the phenomenon or itscauses and effects in the lives of people.Of course, scientists would make a careful distinctionbetween a phenomenon and its effects, on the other hand,explaining what it is and how it works. Great benefit couldcome from more attention to phenomenology and the manyinstances of its effects on the lives of people.The nature and extent of spiritual healing should be morecritically examined. While success seems a random effectthat is rare, many proven cases defy medical explanation.By its very nature, any effort to make Earth a healthy,peaceful planet must be achieved through a great spiritualawakening of a kind that will foster the nurture and care ofEarth and a creative happy life for all its people.\u2014John McConnell  of Earth Day; his new program for savingEarth is called the Earth Trustee Agenda(www.earthsite.org).",

IL-2 is produced commercial-ly by recombinant DNA technology and used for thetreatment of metastatic renal (i.e., kidney) cell cancer.Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is released by lymphocytes (TH-2subset of T helper lymphocytes) and promotes anti-body production by stimulating B cells to proliferateand mature and promotes allergic responses via pro-duction of the immunoglobulin IgE. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) affects many different cells in the immune systemby inducing differentiation and activation. Inter-leukin-10 (IL-10), like IL-4, is released by lympho-cytes (the TH-2 subset of T helper lymphocytes).IL-10 enhances the humoral response and increasesantibody production.

The son of a miningengineer, he taught himself to read by age five. Heattended the local high school and developed an inter-est in biology.In 1862 Koch attended the University of G\u00f6ttingento study medicine under professor of anatomy JacobHenle. In 1840 Henle had published that living, para-sitic organisms caused infectious diseases. In 1866Koch married Emmy Fraats and they had one daughter.After receiving his M.D. degree, Koch went to Berlinfor further study. In 1867, after a period as assistant inthe general hospital at Hamburg, he settled into generalpractice at Langenhagen and, in 1869, at Rackwitz, inthe province of Posen. There he passed his district med-ical officer\u2019s examination, but in 1870 he volunteeredto serve in the Franco-Prussian War. From 1872 to1880 he was district medical officer for Wollstein andwhile there carried out his groundbreaking research.Studying from his four-room flat, with a micro-scope and other equipment he purchased, he beganresearch on anthrax, earlier discovered by other scien-tists to be caused by a bacillus. Koch wanted to provewhether or not anthrax was actually caused by thebacillus, and he used mice and bacilli taken from thespleens of dead farm animals. He found that the micedid die from the bacillus and proved that the blood ofanthrax-infected animals transmitted it. He also showedthat the bacilli could produce resistance spores whenenvironmental conditions were unfavorable, and thatthey could reemerge as viable anthrax-causing organ-isms when conditions changed. Koch\u2019s work becameinternationally known when it was published in 1876.He was the first person to establish a definite causalconnection between a particular disease and a particularbacillus. He continued working on methods of studyingbacteria and in 1878 published his results that includedhow to control infections caused by bacteria.In 1880 he was appointed a member of the Reichs-Gesundheitsamt (Imperial Health Bureau) in Berlin andcontinued to refine his methods in bacteriologicalresearch. He invented new methods of cultivating purecultures of bacteria on solid media and on agar kept inthe special kind of flat dish invented by his colleaguePetri, which is still in common use (the Petri dish). Healso developed new methods of staining bacteria, mak-ing them easily visible for identification. All of thiswork helped establish the methods to study pathogenicbacteria easily in pure cultures. Koch also laid down theconditions, known as Koch\u2019s postulates, that must besatisfied before it can be accepted that particular bacte-ria cause particular diseases. These postulates were:\u2022 The specific organism should be shown to be presentin every case of the disease.\u2022 The specific microorganism should be isolated fromthe diseased animal and grown in pure culture onartificial laboratory media such as in a Petri dish.\u2022 The freshly isolated microorganism, when inoculatedinto a healthy laboratory animal, should cause thesame disease seen in the original animal.\u2022 The microorganism should be recovered from theexperimentally infected animal.Koch also discovered the tubercle bacillus, thecause of tuberculosis, and developed a method ofgrowing it in pure culture, and in 1882, he publishedhis now classical work on the bacillus.

He was educated first at the church schoolin Ryazan, the Ryazan Ecclesiastical High School, andthen at the local theological seminary.Pavlov abandoned religion for science when hewas inspired by the progressive ideas of the Russianliterary critic D. I. Pisarev, by Ivan M. Sechenov, thefather of Russian ", 
    "physiology": ", and by the works ofCharles Darwin. In 1870 he enrolled in the physicsand mathematics faculty to take the course in naturalscience.Pavlov became interested in physiology. While tak-ing the course in natural science, he and a fellow stu-dent wrote a treatise on the physiology of thepancreatic nerves that won wide acclaim, and Pavlovwas awarded a gold medal.In 1875 Pavlov received the degree of candidate ofnatural sciences. However, his overwhelming interest inphysiology forced him to continue his studies andattend the Academy of Medical Surgery. Pavlov won afellowship at the academy, and with a position as direc-tor of the physiological laboratory at the clinic of thefamous Russian clinician, S. P. Botkin, he was able tocontinue his research work. In 1881 Pavlov marriedSeraphima (Sara) Vasilievna Karchevskaya, a teacher,the daughter of a doctor. They had four sons and adaughter. In 1883 he presented his thesis, entitled \u201cThecentrifugal nerves of the heart,\u201d and laid down thebasic principles on the trophic function of the nervoussystem. Pavlov showed that there existed a basic pat-tern in the reflex regulation of the activity of the circu-latory organs.In 1890 Pavlov organized and directed the depart-ment of physiology at the Institute of ExperimentalMedicine and spent the next 45 years making it one ofthe most important centers of physiological research.Also, in 1890 he was appointed professor of pharma-cology at the Military Medical Academy, and five yearslater he was appointed to the then-vacant chair ofphysiology, which he held until 1925.Between the years 1891 and 1900, Pavlov didthe bulk of his research on the physiology of diges-tion at the Institute of Experimental Medicine anddemonstrated that the nervous system played thedominant part in regulating the ", 
    "digestive process": ".Pavlov promoted his research in lectures that hedelivered in 1895 and published under the title sii o rabote glavnykh pishchevaritelnyteh zhelez (Lectures on the function of the principal digestiveglands) in 1897.His research on the physiology of digestion led tothe development of the first experimental model oflearning, called classical conditioning. Pavlov\u2019s researchinto the physiology of digestion led to the study of con-ditioned reflexes. In a now-classic experiment, hetrained a hungry dog to salivate at the sound of a bell,which was previously associated with the sight of food.He implanted small stomach pouches in dogs to mea-sure the secretion of gastric juices produced when thedogs began to eat.In 1901 he was elected a corresponding member ofthe Russian Academy of Sciences, and in 1904 he wasawarded a Nobel Prize for his work in digestion. In1907 he was elected academician of the Russian Acade-my of Sciences, and in 1912 he was given an honorarydoctorate at Cambridge University. He held many otherhonorary memberships of various scientific societiesabroad. Finally, upon the recommendation of the Med-ical Academy of Paris, he was awarded the Order ofthe Legion of Honor (1915).After the Russian Revolution, a special governmentdecree signed by Lenin on January 24, 1921, noted\u201cthe outstanding scientific services of Academician I.

Radioactive elementstend to concentrate in human-made artifacts, igneousrocks, the continental crust, and so the technique is notvery useful for sedimentary rocks, although in somecases, when certain elements are found, it is possible todate them using this technique. Other radiometric dat-ing techniques used are:Electrons become trapped in the crystal lattice of min-erals from adjacent radioactive material and alter themagnetic field of the mineral at a known rate. Thisnondestructive technique is used for dating bone andshell, since exposure to magnetic fields does notdestroy the material (e.g., carbonates [calcium] in lime-stone, coral, egg shells, and teeth).This technique is used for dating glassy material likeobsidian or any artifacts that contain uranium-bear-ing material, such as natural or human-made glass,ceramics, or stones that were used in hearths for foodpreparation. Narrow fission tracks from the releaseof high-energy charged alpha particles burn into thematerial as a result of the decay of uranium 238 tolead 206 (half-life of 4.47 billion years) or induced bythe irradiation of uranium 235 to lead 207 (half-lifeof 704 million years). The number of tracks is pro-portional to the time since the material cooled fromits original molten condition, i.e., fission tracks arecreated at a constant rate throughout time, so it ispossible to determine the amount of time that haspassed since the track accumulation began from thenumber of tracks present. This technique is good fordates from 20 million to 1 billion years ago. U-238fission track techniques are from spontaneous fission,and induced-fission tracking from U-235 is a tech-nique involving controlled irradiation of the artifactwith thermal neutrons of U-235. Both techniques givea thermal age for the material in question. The spon-taneous fission of uranium-238 was first discoveredby the Russian scientists K. A. Petrzhak and G. N.Flerov in 1940.This method has been used to date rocks as old as 4 billion years and is a popular dating technique forarcheological material.

After studyingmathematics in Bourges he moved to Paris in 1703 atage 20 and under the eye of a relative. Like most scien-tists of the time, he made contributions in a number ofareas, including meteorology. His work in mathematicsallowed him entrance to the Academy of Sciences in1708. Two years later, he was put in charge of compil-ing a description of the industrial and natural resourcesin France, and as a result he developed a broad-basedview of the sciences. It also inspired him to invention,which led him into the annals of weather and climateand, ultimately, the invention of a thermometer andtemperature scale.In 1713 R\u00e9aumur made spun-glass fibers that weremade of the same material as today\u2019s building blocks ofEthernet networking and fiber-optic cable. A few yearslater, in 1719, after observing wasps building nests, hesuggested that paper could be made from wood inresponse to a critical shortage of papermaking materials(rags) at the time. He also was impressed by the geomet-rical perfection of the beehive\u2019s hexagonal cells and pro-posed that they be used as a unit of measurement.He turned his interests from industrial resourcessuch as steel to temperature, and in 1730 he presented tothe Paris Academy his study \u201cA Guide for the Produc-tion of Thermometers with Comparable Scales.\u201d Hewanted to improve the reliability of ",
