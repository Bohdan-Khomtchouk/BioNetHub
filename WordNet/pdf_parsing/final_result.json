For this work, he received the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in 1930. In 1936 he wrote  Serological Reactions,   establish the science of immunochemistry. In 1940 he discovered the Rh factor, the protein on the surface of red blood cells that determines if the blood type is positive (Rh-positive) or negative (Rh-negative). If the mother has a negative Rh factor (Rh-negative) and the father and fetus are Rh-positive, the mother can become Rh-sensitized and produce antibodies to com- bat fetal blood cells that cross the placenta into her bloodstream. These antibodies can destroy the fetus\u2019s Rh-positive blood cells, putting it at serious risk of anemia. In 1939 he became emeritus professor at the Rock- efeller Institute. On June 24, 1943, he had a heart attack in his laboratory and died two days later. "

Abscisic acid was named based on a belief that the hormone caused the abscission (shedding) of leaves from deciduous trees during the fall. At times when a plant needs to slow down growth and assume a resting (dormant) stage, abscisic acid is produced in the terminal bud, which slows down growth and directs the leaf primordia to develop scales that protect the dormant bud during winter. Because the hormone also inhibits cell division in the vascular cambium, both primary and secondary growth are put on hold during winter. This hormone also acts as a stress agent that helps a plant deal with adverse conditions. For example, ABA accumulates on leaves and causes stomata to close, reducing the loss of water when a plant begins to wilt. In 1963, abscisic acid was first identified and char- acterized by Frederick Addicott and colleagues. In 1965, the chemical structure of ABA was defined, and in 1967, it was formally called abscisic acid. "

In 1926 he was appointed the Royal Society\u2019s Foulerton research professor and was in charge of  the biophysics laboratory at University College until 1952. His work on muscle function, especially the obser- vation and measurement of thermal changes associated with muscle function, was later extended to similar studies on the mechanism of the passage of nerve impulses. He coined the term  the process of recovery after exercise.

Algae, some 17,000 species or more, live in aquatic and moist inland regions. They do not have roots, stems, or leaves and have no vascular water-conducting systems. They reproduce by spores, and in some species the spores are mobile with the use of flagella. They range from simple single cells (e.g.,  (e.g., kelps such as  seaweed and much of the plankton that provide food for other species.

The two orders, Centrales and Pennales, occupy two different environments. The centric diatoms (Centrales) are circular in shape with radial symmetry and live mostly in marine environments.

The Charophyceae, also known as stoneworts, and which resemble bryophytes, live in fresh and brackish water especially rich in calcium, where they become stiff and lime encrusted. The stoneworts consist of a complex branched thallus with an erect stemlike struc- ture and many whorls of short branches. The Chlorophyceae (or green algae) are the closest to plants in pigment composition and structure and are related based on a common ancestor. More than 7,000 species live in freshwater and marine environments as unicellular parts of plankton, in damp soil and even snow as colonies or filaments, symbiotically with other eukaryotes, or mutually with fungi as lichens. The Chrysophyceae or golden algae, named because of their yellow and brown carotene and xan- thophyll pigments, are typically cells with two flagella at one end of the cell, and many live among freshwater and marine plankton. While most are unicellular, a few are colonial. The Dinophyceae or dinoflagellates are algae that are unicellular with two flagella of unequal length con- tained in channels on the cell surface. They can change shape with different water temperatures and are very tolerant of chemical and physical conditions. The Phaeophyceae or brown algae are the largest and most complex of the algae. All members are multi- cellular, and the majority live in marine environments, especially common in cool water along temperate coast- lines. Many of the marine seaweeds are brown algae. The Rhodophyceae or red algae are more recent and have lost their flagellate stages in their life cycle. Some species are actually black and not red, as those that live deeper in waters, because of different levels of the pigment phycoerythrin.

Several populations of the Karner blue butterfly are now sepa- rated from each other by human-made development and may be evolving into separate subspecies or species, even though geographically they are isolated by only a few miles in some cases. Conditions that favor allopatric speciation are when one population becomes isolated at the fringe of the parent population\u2019s range. This splinter population, called a peripheral isolate, is likely to become allopatric because the gene pool of the isolate may already be dif- ferent, since living on the border of the range encour- ages the expression of the extremes of any genotypic CLINE s that existed in the original population. Further- more, if the population is small enough, a  FOUNDER EFFECT will occur, giving rise to a gene pool that is not that of the parent population. Genetic drift will also occur until the peripheral isolate becomes a larger population and will continue to change the gene pool at random until the population grows. New mutations or combinations of existing alleles that are neutral in adaptive value now may become fixed in the population by chance, causing genotypic or phenotypic divergence from the parent population. For example, the Karner blue butterfly has a row of orange spots on the top of the hindwing, whereas, the ancestral parent, the Melissa blue butter- fly, has orange spots on the top of both front and hind- wing, a phenotypic variation.

    "alternation of generations": [
        "  A life cycle in plants where there is both a multicellular diploid form (the sporophyte generation) and a multicellular haploid form (the gametophyte generation). Gametophytes produce haploid gametes that fuse zygotes that are forming. These zygotes then develop into diploid sporophytes. Meiosis in the sporophytes produces haploid spores, with division by meiosis giv- ing rise to the next generation of gametophytes. Alternation of generations occurs in plants and cer- tain species of  ALGAE . Ferns and fern allies (such as the club moss) are common examples that display alterna- tion of generations. The above ground parent fern plant (the diploid sporophyte, or spore-bearing plant) has two full sets of chromosomes (two of each kind of chromosome). It sheds its single-celled haploid spores, having one set of chromosomes (one of each kind), which fall to the ground, and these in turn grow into a different plant, the gametophyte or prothallus, also haploid. The gametophyte has special bodies within the plant called archegonia (female cells) and antheridia (male cells). Here sexual fertilization takes place, and a new diploid sporophyte then grows.

The following is a list of symbols for amino acids (use of the one-letter symbols should be restricted to the comparison of long sequences): aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases  (aaRSs)  When ribo- somes pair a tRNA (transfer ribonucleic acid) with a codon (three bases in a DNA or RNA sequence), an amino acid is expected to be carried by the tRNA. Since each tRNA is matched with its amino acid before it meets the ribosome, the ribosome has no way of knowing if the match was made. The match is made by a family of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These enzymes charge each tRNA with the proper amino acid via a covalent ester bond, allowing each tRNA to make the proper translation from the genetic code of DNA into the amino acid code of proteins. Cells make at least 20 different aminoacyl-tRNS synthetases, one for each of the amino acids. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two classes, depending on which amino acid they specify. Class I enzymes usually are monomeric and attach to the carobxyl of their specific amino acid to the 2\u2019 OH of adenosine 76 in the tRNA molecule. Class II enzymes are either dimeric or tetrameric and attach to their amino acids at the 3\u2019 OH. These enzymes  catalyze first by activating the amino acid by forming an aminoacyl-adenylate. Here the carboxyl of the amino acid is linked to the alpha-phosphate of ATP, displacing pyrophosphate. After the corrected tRNA is bound, the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl- adenylate is transferred to the 2\u2019 or 3\u2019 terminal OH of the tRNA. Recent studies have shown that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can tell the difference between the right and the wrong tRNA before they ever start catalysis, and if the enzyme binds aminoacyl-adenylate first, it is even more specific during tRNA binding. Previous studies have also proved that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases reject wrong tRNAs during catalysis. Other research has shown that specific aaRSs play roles in cellular fidelity, tRNA processing, RNA splicing, RNA traffick- ing, apoptosis, and transcriptional and translational regulation. These new revelations may present new evolutionary models for the development of cells and perhaps opportunities for pharmaceutical advance- ments. amino group  (\u2013NH  2  )  A functional group (group of atoms within a molecule that is responsible for certain properties of the molecule and reactions in which it takes part), common to all amino acids, that consists of a nitrogen atom bonded covalently to two hydrogen atoms, leaving a lone valence electron on the nitrogen atom capable of bonding to another atom.

    "amniocentesis": [
        "  Amniocentesis is the removal of about two tablespoons of amniotic fluid via a needle inserted through the maternal abdomen into the uterus and amniotic sac. This is done to gain information about the condition, and even the sex, of the fetus. The fluid contains cells from the fetus and placenta. Some women have a greater chance of giving birth to a baby with a chromosome problem, and amniocente- sis can provide the answers if performed at about 16 weeks gestation (second trimester) or later. Chromosome analysis and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) tests are two such tests, and these check for chromosome abnormalities such as Down\u2019s syndrome and whether there are any openings in the fetal skin, such as in the spine, that could lead to neural-tube defects like spina bifida or anen- cephaly, or inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis. While the procedure is relatively safe, some prob- lems that can occur are miscarriage (1 in 200, or 0.5 percent chance), cramping, and infections (less than 1 in 1,000). Amniocentesis can also be performed during the second and third trimesters to determine fetal lung maturity, to verify the health of the fetus in cases of Rh sensitivity, and to identify any infections. First used in 1882 to remove excess amniotic fluid, it is often used in late pregnancy to test for anemia in fetuses with Rh disease and to check if the fetal lungs are advanced enough for delivery to occur.

There are more than 11,000 species of amphibians, and they are believed to be the first vertebrate species to live on land. Located between the fish and reptiles on the evolu- tionary scale, they are the most primitive of the terres- trial vertebrates and undergo a metamorphosis from water-breathing limbless larva (tadpole) to land-loving, or partly terrestrial, air-breathing four-legged adult. Eggs are typically deposited in water or a wet pro- tected place, although some do lay eggs in dry places. The eggs are not shelled and do not possess the mem- branes that are common in reptiles or higher verte- brates. Adults have moist skins with no scales or small scales, and they are specialized in living habitats. Each has its own evolutionary adaptations from the jumping ability (over 17 feet in some cases) of frogs and toads, to the limbless caecilians, to the long tails of the sala- manders and newts. For example, frogs can enter aesti- vation, a period of dormancy similar to hibernation, when experiencing long periods of heat or drought conditions, and they can breathe through their skin in a process called cutaneous gas exchange.

    "Aristotle": [
        "  (384  B . C . E .\u2013322  B . C . E .) Greek  Aristotle, a Greek philosopher and scientist, has  had more influence on the field of science than any- one. His influence, which lasted more than 2,000 years, was due to the fact that he was the first to depart from the old Platonic school of thinking by reasoning that accurate observation, description, inductive reasoning, and interpretation was the way to understand the natural world. Since he was the first to use this method, he is often called the \u201cFather of Natural History.\u201d Born in 384  B . C . E . in the Ionian colony of Stagirus (now Macedonia), Aristotle was the son of Nico- machus, a physician and grandfather of Alexander the Great. At 17, he became a student in Plato\u2019s academy in Athens and stayed there for more than 20 years as a student and teacher. In 347  B . C . E ., he moved to the princedom of Atarneus in Mysia (northwestern Asia Minor), ruled by Hermias, and who presided over a small circle of Plato followers in the town of Assos. Aristotle befriended Hermias, joined the group, and eventually married Hermias\u2019s niece and adopted daugh- ter Pythias. Around 342  B . C . E ., he moved to Mieza, near the Macedonian capital Pella, to supervise the education of 13-year-old Alexander the Great. Aristotle returned to Athens in 335  B . C . E . to teach, promote research projects, and organize a library in the Lyceum. His school was known as the Peripatetic School. After Alexander\u2019s death in 323  B . C . E ., Aristotle was prose- cuted and had to leave Athens, leaving his school to Theophrastus. He died shortly after at Chalcis in Euboea in 322  B . C . E .

Aristotle\u2019s observations in the biological sciences had some validity, but many of his observations and conclusions regarding weather and climate were wrong, and it was not until the 17th century\u2014with the invention of meteorological instruments such as the hygrometer, thermometer, and barometer\u2014that his ideas were disproved scientifically. However, he cor- rectly reasoned that the earth was a sphere, recorded information regarding the bathymetry of seas, correctly interpreted dolphins and whales as mammals, separat- ed vertebrates into oviparous and viviparous, and described and named many organisms, including crus- taceans and worms, mollusks, echinoderms, and fish from the Aegean Sea.

    "Arrhenius, Svante August": [
        "  (1859\u20131927) Swedish Chemist, Physicist  Svante August Arrhenius was born in Vik (or Wijk), near Uppsala, Sweden, on February 19, 1859. He was the second son of Svante Gustav Arrhenius and Carolina Christina (n\u00e9e Thunberg). Svante\u2019s father was a surveyor and an administrator of his family\u2019s estate at Vik. In 1860, a year after Arrhe- nius was born, his family moved to Uppsala, where his father became a supervisor at the university. He was reading by the age of three. Arrhenius received his early education at the cathedral school in Uppsala, excelling in biology, physics, and mathematics. In 1876, he entered the University of Uppsala and studied physics, chemistry, and mathematics, receiving his B.S. two years later. While he continued graduate classes for three years in physics at Uppsala, his studies were not completed there. Instead, Arrhenius transferred to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1881 to work under Erick Edlund to conduct research in the field of electrical theory. Arrhenius studied electrical conductivity of dilute solutions by passing electric current through a variety of solutions. His research determined that molecules in some of the substances split apart, or dissociated from each other, into two or more ions when they were dissolved in a liquid. He found that while each intact molecule was electrically balanced, the split particles carried a small positive or negative electrical charge when dissolved in water. The charged atoms permitted the passage of electricity, and the electrical current directed the active components toward the electrodes. His thesis on the theory of ionic dissocia- tion was barely accepted by the University of Uppsala in 1884, since the faculty believed that oppositely charged particles could not coexist in solution. He received a grade that prohibited him from being able to teach. Arrhenius published his theories (\u201cInvestigations on the Galvanic Conductivity of Electrolytes\u201d) and sent copies of his thesis to a number of leading Euro- pean scientists. Russian-German chemist Wilhelm Ost- wald, one of the leading European scientists of the day and one of the principal founders of physical chem- istry, was impressed and visited him in Uppsala, offer- ing him a teaching position, which he declined. However, Ostwald\u2019s support was enough for Uppsala to give him a lecturing position, which he kept for two years. The Stockholm Academy of Sciences awarded Arrhenius a traveling scholarship in 1886. As a result, he worked with Ostwald in Riga with physicist Friedrich Kohlrausch at the University of Wurzburg, with physicist Ludwig Boltzmann at the University of Graz, and with chemist Jacobus Van\u2019t Hoff at the Uni- versity of Amsterdam. In 1889, he formulated his rate equation that is used for many chemical transforma- tions and processes, in which the rate is exponentially related to temperature, known as the \u201cArrhenius equation.\u201d He returned to Stockholm in 1891 and became a lecturer in physics at Stockholm\u2019s Hogskola (high school) and was appointed physics professor in 1895 and rector in 1897. Arrhenius married Sofia Rudbeck in 1894 and had one son. The marriage lasted a short two years. Arrhenius continued his work on elec- trolytic dissociation and added the study of osmotic pressure. In 1896, he made the first quantitative link between changes in carbon dioxide concentration and climate. He calculated the absorption coefficients of carbon dioxide and water based on the emission spec- trum of the moon, and he also calculated the amount Arrhenius, Svante August  27 "

He like- wise believed that spores might have populated many other planets, resulting in life throughout the universe. In 1902, he received the Davy Medal of the Royal Society and proposed a theory of immunology. The fol- lowing year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chem- istry for his work that originally had been perceived as improbable by his Uppsala professors.

He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society in 1911, the same year he received the Willard Gibbs Medal of the American Chemical Society. Three years later he was awarded the Faraday Medal of the British Chemical Society. He was also a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences and the German Chemi- cal Society. During the latter part of his life his interests includ- ed the chemistry of living matter and astrophysics, espe- cially the origins and fate of stars and planets.

Domagk, Gerhard Johannes Paul  (1895\u20131964) German  Gerhard Johannes Paul Domagk was born on October 30, 1895, in Lagow, a small town in the Brandenburg Marches. He attended school in Sommerfeld, where his father was assistant headmaster, until age 14. His mother, Martha Reimer, came from farming stock in the Marches, where she lived in Som- merfeld until 1945, when she was expelled from her home and died from starvation in a refugee camp. Domagk became a medical student at Kiel and served in the army during World War I. After being wounded in 1914, he worked in the cholera hospitals in Russia. He noticed that medicine of the time had lit- tle success, and he was moved by the helplessness of the medical men of that time in treating cholera, typhus, diarrhea infections, and other infectious dis- eases. He recognized that surgery had little value in the treatment of these diseases, and also noticed that amputations and other radical treatments were often followed by severe bacterial infections. In 1918 he resumed his medical studies at Kiel and graduated in 1921. In 1923 he moved to Greifswald and a year later became a university lecturer in patho- logical anatomy. In 1925 he held the same post at the University of M\u00fcnster and in 1958 became a professor. During the years 1927\u201329 he was given a leave of absence from the University of M\u00fcnster to do research in the laboratories of the I. G. Farbenindustrie, at Wup- pertal.

His mother, Maria Hock, was the daughter of a well-known Prague scientist. The young B\u00e1r\u00e1ny contracted tubercu- losis, which resulted in permanent knee problems. He completed medical studies at Vienna University in 1900, and in 1903, he accepted a post as demonstra- tor at the otological clinic.

The middle ear\u2019s vestibular system is made up of three semicircular canals and an otolith. Inside the canals are fluid and hairlike cilia that register movement. As the head moves, so does the fluid, which in turn moves the cilia that send signals to the brain and nervous system. The function of the otolith, a series of calcium fibers that remain oriented to gravity, is similar. Both help the body to stay upright. B\u00e1r\u00e1ny\u2019s contributions in this area won him the Nobel Prize in physiology in 1914. To receive his award, he had to be released from a Russian prisoner of war camp in 1916 at the request of the prince of Sweden. After the war he accepted the post of principal and professor of the Otological Institute in Uppsala, where he remained for the remainder of his life. During the latter part of his life, B\u00e1r\u00e1ny studied the causes of muscular rheumatism. Although he suffered a stroke, this did not prevent him from writing on the subject. He died at Uppsala on April 8, 1936. An elite organization called the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society is named after him and is devoted to vestibular research. 34  bacteriochlorophyll "

It transports nourishment from digestion, hormones from glands, carries disease-fighting substances to tis- sues, as well as wastes to the kidneys. Blood contains red and white blood cells and platelets that are respon- sible for a variety of functions, from transporting sub- stances to fighting invasion from foreign substances. Some 55 percent of blood is a clear liquid called plas- ma. The average adult has about five liters of blood. See also  ARTERY ; CAPILLARY ; VEIN . blood-brain barrier  (BBB)  The blood-brain barrier is a collection of cells that press together to block many substances from entering the brain while allowing oth- ers to pass. It is a specialized arrangement of brain cap- illaries that restricts the passage of most substances into the brain, thereby preventing dramatic fluctuations in the brain\u2019s environment. It maintains the chemical envi- ronment for neuron functions and protects the brain from the entry of foreign and harmful substances. It allows substances in the brain such as glucose, certain ions, and oxygen and others to enter, while unwanted ones are carried out by the endothelial cells. It is a defensive system to protect the central nervous system. What is little understood is how the blood-brain barrier is regulated, or why certain diseases are able to manipulate and pass through the barrier. There is evidence that multiple sclerosis attacks occur during breakdowns of the blood-brain barrier. A study in rats showed that flavinoids, such as those found in blueberries and grape seeds among others, can inhibit blood-brain barrier breakdown under condi- tions that normally lead to such breakdown. Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have identified a receptor in the human brain that regulates the interface between the bloodstream and the blood-brain barrier and could lead to a new understanding of this nearly impenetrable barrier and to treatment of diseases that affect the brain. They found that two proteins, ",

    "serology": [
        ", which involves the identification and characteri- zation of blood and body fluids, either in a liquid or dried state, in association with a criminal or civil investigation. Blood and dried bloodstains are two of the most important and most frequently encountered types of evidence in crim- inal investigation of crimes such as homicides, assaults, and rapes. Since the 1900s, forensic serologists have attempted to identify blood and/or bloodstains found at crime scenes. When serology was in its early stages, stains at crime scenes were identified just as blood. Now that forensic serologists can individualize human blood by identifying all of its known factors, the result could be evidence of the strongest kind for linking a suspect to the crime scene or finding a lost victim. When examining dried bloodstains, the forensic serol- ogists are trying to determine the following: (1) Is the stain blood? (2) If the stain is blood, is it human or animal? (3) If probe DNA labeling with fluorescent dye denature & hybridize Fluorescence in situ hybridization is a process that vividly paints chromosomes or portions of chromosomes with fluorescent  molecules.

The main features of the molecular architecture of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were first formulated by Wat- son and Crick in 1953, who at the same time pointed out how the proposed structure would account for the three basic attributes of genetic material: gene specificity, gene replication, and gene mutation. It was not until 1985 that forensic scientists discovered that portions of the DNA structure of certain genes are as unique to an individual as their fingerprints. Alec Jeffreys and his colleagues at Leicester University, England, who were responsible for these revelations, named the process for isolating and reading these DNA markers \u201cDNA fingerprinting.\u201d The DNA typing of biological fluid and stains finally gives the forensic scientist the ability to link crime scene evidence such as bloodstains to a single individual.

Another chemical used for screening stains for blood is phenolph- thalein. Both tests consist of a two-step procedure. The first step is to moisten a white filter paper with distilled water. Apply the filter paper to the suspected bloodstain. A portion of the stain will transfer onto the moistened paper. Add the leucomalachite green reagent to the paper. The second step is to add hydrogen peroxide to the filter paper and look for a color change on the paper. A positive result will yeild a bluish-green color. When phe- nolphthalein is mixed with a dried bloodstain, with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the hemoglobin in the blood causes the formation of a deep pink color. The leu- comalachite green test is a presumptive test for blood that is used by many laboratories today. The heme group in hemoglobin catalyzes the oxidation by peroxide of the malachite green to produce a bluish-green reaction when the suspected stain is blood. Luminol is a chemical reagent that is very useful in locating small traces of blood at a crime scene. Unlike the above-mentioned chemical screening test, the reaction of luminol with blood results in the production of light rather than color. The one requirement for the use of luminol is that the scene be completely dark. Luminol is a chemical that can be used as a spray at crime scenes and will react with any blood present, causing a luminescence. The second step in blood identification is the use of confirmatory tests. Confirmatory blood identification tests are specific for the heme component of hemoglobin. A posi- tive confirmatory test result is taken as positive proof of the presence of blood in a questioned stain. Some of the confir- matory tests include: "

The Teichmann (1853) and the Takayama (1905) confirmatory tests are based on the obser- vation that heme, in the presence of certain chemicals, will form characteristic crystals that can be seen using a micro- scope. The precipitin test is based on antibody molecules interacting with antigens to form a precipitate that can be visualized under the proper light conditions or with a stain. Serologists use this test to determine whether the origin of the bloodstain is human or animal. The ring precipitin test involves layering a dilute saline extract of the bloodstain on top of the antihuman serum in a capillary tube. Because of the density of the antihuman serum, the bloodstain extract will layer on top, and the two solutions will not mix, thus forming a cloudy ring or band at the interface between the two solutions. The gel diffusion method is based on the fact that anti- gens and antibodies will diffuse, or move toward each other, on an agar-gel-coated plate, such as the Ouchterlony plate. The extracted bloodstain and the human antiserum are placed in separate holes opposite each other on the gel. A white precipitate line will form where the antigens and antibodies meet if the bloodstain is of human origin. The electrophoretic method, or crossover elec- trophoresis, is a sensitive method using an electric current that is passed through a gel plate. A line of precipitation formed between the hole containing the bloodstain extract and the hole containing the human antiserum denotes a specific antigen antibody reaction. The next generation of confirmatory test, which in some forensic laboratories has replaced the electrophoret- ic or crossover electrophoresis is called the One Step ABAcard HemaTrace. This test utilizes a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents to selectively detect human hemoglobin. Adding a portion of the prepared elution from the bloodstain to the sample well and observ- ing the development of indicative colored lines conduct the test. The species specificity of the reaction is based on the recognition by antibodies of antigens displayed on human hemoglobin. A positive result is visualized because gold- conjugated, monoclonal antibody-Hb immune complexes are captured and condensed on the test mambrane by sta- tionary phase polyclonal anti-human hemoglobin antibod- ies, causing the gold particles to condense. This produces a pink-colored line at the test area. Absence of this colored line indicates a negative result. There are many different substances in human blood that can be grouped to individualize the blood. Blood con- tains many inherited factors referred to as genetic markers. Determination of factors in a person\u2019s blood is called blood grouping or blood typing.

The proce- dure has been modified and improved with the development of new antisera. In this test, which detects antibodies in dried bloodstains, two portions of the stains are placed onto microscope slides. Type A red cells are added to one glass slide, and Type B red cells to the other slide. If the blood- stain on the slide contains anti-A antibodies, the A red cells that were added will agglutinate, which looks like crosslinked cells under the microscope. Agglutination of the A cells indicates that anti-A is present, and therefore, that the bloodstain is of blood group B. The other approach to typing dried bloodstains is the detection of the antigens that are on the surface of the red blood cells. When blood dries, the red cells break apart, but the red blood cell antigens are still present in the dried stains. The two major methods that have been used are absorption- inhibition and absorption-elution. The absorption-inhibition method depends on the ability to estimate the amount of antibody present in an antiserum before and after exposure to a stain extract containing a possible antigen. The "

Removing specific antibodies from complexes with their antigens in this way is called elution. Another main class of blood constituents used as genetic markers is the "

Once the radioactive sequences are on the nylon membrane, the membrane is exposed to a piece of X-ray film. The developed X-ray film shows DNA fragments that combined with radioactive probe. The size of the bloodstain (i.e., the amount of blood required) on forensic evidence and the time required to obtain the DNA information from the evidence were two drawbacks to this procedure.

PCR has revolutionized the approach to the recovery of DNA from a variety of sources. Availability of oligonucleotide primers is the key to the amplification process. PCR consists of three steps, beginning with the denaturing of the double-strand DNA, separated by heating to 90\u201396\u00b0C. The second step involves hybridization or annealing, in which one primer is annealed to the flanking end of each DNA target sequence comple- mentary strand. The third step uses a thermally stable Taq polymerase to mediate the extension of the primers. The result is two new helices in place of the first, each one composed of the original strands plus its newly assembled complementary strand. All eukaryotic genomes contain regions of simple repetitive DNA, called short tandem repeats (STR) or microsatellites, which consist of variable numbers of tan- dem repeats (VNTRs). The number of repeats at an STR locus can be highly variable among individuals, resulting in different-length polymorphisms that can be detected by relatively simple use of the PCR-based assays. STR loci are useful to forensic science because of their small range of alleles, their high sensitivity, and suitability even if the DNA is degraded. Today the forensic laboratory using the PCR/STR analysis can individualize bloodstains obtained from forensic evidence with a very high probability of iden- tifying a single individual. In the past, forensic scientists who handled biological forensic evidence were only able to tell the investigating official whether the dried stain at the crime scene was blood. Today the forensic laboratory reports contain informa- tion about dried stains at crime scenes that can be related to one individual. This information has been tremendously help- ful in the investigation of crimes. With the establishment of a DNA database, physical evidence collected from the crime scene that contains biological stains can be analyzed even if there is no suspect. The DNA profile developed from forensic bloodstain evidence can be compared with various DNA databases to develop a match, which could lead to identification of an individual. \u2014John C.

Carrel was educated at home by his mother Anne Ricard and at St. Joseph School, in Lyons. He received a bachelor of letters degree in 1889 from the University of Lyons, a bache- lor of science the following year, and, in 1900, his Ph.D. at the same university. He worked as prosector at the Lyons Hospital and taught anatomy and operative surgery at the university. By 1906, he was at the Rocke- feller Institute for Medical Research, where he carried out most of his landmark experiments. Influenced by the assassination by knife of the pres- ident of France in 1894, he dedicated himself to develop a way to suture blood vessels, which ironically he devel- oped after he studied with a French embroidress who showed him how to do embroidery. His first attempt was made in France in 1902. He subsequently devel- oped the triangulation technique of vascular suture. He won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1912 for his work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs. During World War I, Carrel served as a major in the French army medical corps and helped devise a widely used method of treating war wounds, called the Carrel-Dakin method, a method of wound irrigation in which the wound is intermittently irrigated with Dakin\u2019s solution, a germicidal fluid (no longer used). Carrel\u2019s researches were mainly concerned with experimental surgery and the transplantation of tissues and whole organs. As early as 1902, he published a tech- nique for the end-to-end "

In 1908, he devised methods for the transplantation of whole organs and had tested kidney and heart transplantations as early as 1905. In 1910 he demonstrated that blood vessels could be kept for long periods in cold storage before they were used as transplants in surgery, and he also conducted aortocoro- nary bypass surgery, before the advent of anticoagulants. In 1935, in collaboration with Charles Lindbergh, Carrel devised a machine for supplying a sterile respira- tory system to organs removed from the body. Carrel was able to perform surgeries that showed that circula- tion, even in such vital organs as the kidneys, could be interrupted for as long as two hours without causing permanent damage.

    "Celsius, Anders": [
        "  (1701\u20131744) Swedish  Physicist  Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer, physicist, and mathematician who introduced the Cel- sius temperature scale that is used today by scientists in most countries. He was born in Uppsala, Sweden, a city that has produced six Nobel Prize winners. Celsius was born into a family of scientists, all originating from the province of H\u00e4lsingland. His father Nils Cel- sius was a professor of astronomy, as was his grandfa- ther Anders Spole. His other grandfather, Magnus Celsius, was a professor of mathematics. Both grandfa- thers were at the university in Uppsala. Several of his uncles were also scientists. Celsius\u2019s important contributions include determin- ing the shape and size of the Earth; gauging the magni- tude of the stars in the constellation Aries; publication of a catalog of 300 stars and their magnitudes; obser- vations on eclipses and other astronomical events; and a study revealing that the Nordic countries were slowly rising above the sea level of the Baltic. His most famous contribution falls in the area of temperature, and the one he is remembered most for is the creation of the Celsius temperature scale. In 1742 he presented to the Swedish Academy of Sci- ences his paper, \u201cObservations on Two Persistent Degrees on a Thermometer,\u201d in which he presented his observa- tions that all "

    "thermometers": [
        " should be made on a fixed scale of 100 divisions (centigrade) based on two points: 0\u00b0 for boiling water, and 100\u00b0 for freezing water. He pre- sented his argument on the inaccuracies of existing scales and calibration methods and correctly presented the influence of air pressure on the boiling point of water. After his death, the scale that he designed was reversed, giving rise to the existing 0\u00b0 for freezing and 100\u00b0 for boiling water, instead of the reverse. It is not known if this reversal was done by his student Martin Stromer; or by botanist Carolus Linnaeus, who in 1745 reportedly showed the senate at Uppsala University a thermometer so calibrated; or if it was done by Daniel Ekstr\u00f6m, who manufactured most of the thermometers Celsius, Anders  59  glycolysis\u2013 conversion of glucose (or starch or glycogen) to pyruvic acid Acetyl CoA tricarboxylic acid cycle\u2013 oxidation of acetyl to H and CO 2 oxidative phosphorylation with production of ATP ethanol anaerobic  respiration in plants  lactic acid anaerobic  respiration  in animals  aerobic respiration  Cellular respiration is the process in which ATP is created by metab-  olizing glucose and oxygen with the release of carbon dioxide.

The city council placed the four younger Fahrenheit orphans in foster homes and apprenticed Daniel to a merchant who taught him bookkeeping. He was sent to Amsterdam around 1714, where he learned of the Florentine thermometer, invent- ed in Italy 60 years prior in 1654 by the grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand II (1610\u201370), a member of the powerful Medici family. For some unknown reason, it sparked his curiosity and he decided to make ther- mometers for a living. He abandoned his bookkeeping apprenticeship, whereby Dutch authorities issued war- rants for his arrest. While on the run, he spent several years traveling around Europe and meeting scientists, such as Danish astronomer Olaus Roemer. Eventually he returned to Amsterdam in 1717 and remained in the Netherlands for the rest of his life. What seems so simple today\u2014having a fixed scale and fixed points on a thermometer\u2014was not obvious in Fahrenheit\u2019s time, when several makers used differ- ent types of scales and liquids for measuring. In 1694 Carlo Renaldini, a member of the Academia del Cimen- to and professor of philosophy at the University of Pisa, was the first to suggest taking the boiling and freezing points of water as the fixed points. The acade- my was founded by Prince Leopoldo de Medici and the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in 1657 with the purpose of examining the natural philosophy of Aristotle. The academy was active sporadically over 10 years and concluded its work in 1667 with the publication of the Saggi di Naturali Esperienze.  Unfortunately, ", 
        " because of its low coefficient of expansion. Fahrenheit later adjusted his temperature scale to ignore body temperature as a fixed point, bringing the scale to just the freezing and boiling of water. After his death, scientists recalibrated his thermometer so that the boiling point of water was the highest point, chang- ing it to 212 degrees, as Fahrenheit had earlier indicat- ed in a publication on the boiling points of various liquids. The freezing point became 32 degrees, and body temperature became 98.6 degrees. This is the scale that is presently used in thermometers in the Unit- ed States and some English-speaking countries, although most scientists use the Celsius scale. By 1779 there were some 19 different scales being used for thermometers, but it was Fahrenheit, along with astronomer  ANDERS CELSIUS and Jean Christin\u2014 whose scales were presented in 1742 and 1743\u2014who helped finally set the standards for an accurate ther- mometer that are still used today. Besides making ther- mometers, Fahrenheit also was the first to show that the boiling point of liquids varies at different atmo- spheric pressures, and he suggested this as a principle for the construction of barometers. Among his other contributions were a pumping device for draining the Dutch polders and a hygrometer for measuring atmo- spheric humidity. Fahrenheit died on September 16, 1736, in The Hague at the age of 50 years.

In 1939 Florey and Chain headed a team of British scientists, financed by a grant from the Rocke- feller Foundation, whose efforts led to the successful small-scale manufacture of penicillin. They showed that penicillin could protect against infection but that the concentration of penicillin in the human body\u2014 and the length of time of treatment\u2014were important factors for successful treatment. In 1940 a report was issued describing how penicillin had been found to be a chemotherapeutic agent capable of killing sensitive germs in the living body. An effort was made to create sufficient quantities for use in World War II to treat war wounds, and it is estimated to have saved thou- sands of lives. In 1945 Florey was awarded a Nobel Prize in medicine with Alexander Fleming and Ernst Chain. Florey was a contributor to and editor of  otics   tures on general pathology and has had many papers published on physiology and pathology. In 1944 he was created a knight bachelor.

The types of cells examined are usually from peripher- al blood, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, chorionic villi, and solid-tissue biopsies. These tissues are analyzed in diag- nostic procedures in prenatal diagnosis, multiple miscar- riages, newborns and children with abnormal phenotypes and abnormal sexual development, hematological disor- ders, and solid tumors. Autosomal chromosome abnormali- ties generally have more serious consequences than sex chromosome abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities are a major cause of fetal loss. These numbers decrease by birth, and since some trisomies result in early death, their frequency is lower in children and even lower in adults.  Numerical changes are the most common chromo- some abnormalities. Most numerical changes are the result of nondisjunction in the first meiotic division. Mitotic nondisjunction typically results in mosaicism. Chromosome structural changes can be balanced or unbalanced. Struc- tural abnormalities may be losses, rearrangements, or gains, while numerical abnormalities are losses or gains. Both numerical and structural changes may result in pheno- typic abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities may be constitutional or acquired. Constitutional abnormalities may be associated  with phenotypic anomalies (i.e., Down\u2019s syndrome, Turner syn- drome) or result in a normal phenotype (i.e., balanced familial translocation). Acquired abnormalities are usually those asso- ciated with malignant transformation, such as cancers.

FISH can be used for identification of marker chromo- somes, microdeletion syndromes, rearrangements and  deletions, detection of abnormalities in leukemia, myelopro- liferative disorders, and solid tumors. For example, a  chromosome deletion not clearly visible with standard chro- mosome analysis may be detected with a specific probe for the region (i.e., Di George syndrome). Cytogenetic analysis of malignant cells proved valu- able in the diagnosis and in some cases prognosis of hema- tological malignancies. FISH has increased the importance of chromosome analysis in the diagnosis of these patients. Many nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities associated with a specific hematological malignancy have been found. These findings have contributed to the understanding and in some cases treatment of these malignancies. The use of FISH techniques has greatly improved the diagnostic accu- racy because, in addition to specific translocation probes, FISH can detect abnormalities in both interphase and metaphase cells. A current FISH test that may be used for the identifica- tion of subtle rearrangements or to characterize complex translocations involving more than two chromosomes is spectral karyotyping ("

On January 6, 1912, at a meeting of the Geological Association in Frankfurt, he spoke about his ideas of \u201ccontinental displacement\u201d (continental drift), and pre- sented his theory again days later at a meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Natural Science in Marburg. In 1914 he was drafted into the German army, was wounded, and served out the war in the army weather- forecasting service. While recuperating in a military hospital, he further developed his theory of continental drift, which he published the following year as  Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane   continents and oceans).

While he was not the first to suggest that the continents had once been connected, he was the first to present the evidence, although he was wrong in thinking that the continents moved by \u201cplowing\u201d into each other through the ocean floor. His theory was soundly reject- ed, although a few scientists did agree with his premise. In November 1930 he died while returning from a rescue expedition that brought food to a party of his colleagues camped in the middle of the Greenland ice cap. His body was not found until May 12, 1931, but his friends allowed him to rest forever in the area that he loved. The theory of continental drift continued to be controversial for many years, but by the 1950s and 1960s, plate tectonics was all but an accepted fact and taught in schools. Today, we know that both continents and ocean floor float as solid plates on underlying rock that behaves like a viscous fluid due to being under such tremendous heat and pressure. Wegener never lived to see his theory proved. Had he lived, most sci- entists believe he would have been the champion of present-day plate tectonics. "

It is standard practice to think of the ligand atoms that are directly attached to the central atom as defining a coordination polyhedron (tetrahedron, square plane, octahedron, etc.) about the central atom. The coordination number is defined as being equal to the number of sigma-bonds between ligands and the central atom. This definition is not necessarily appropriate in all areas of (coordination) chemistry. In a coordination formula, the central atom is listed first. The formally anionic ligands appear next, and they are listed in alphabetic order according to the first symbols of their formulas. The neutral lig- ands follow, also in alphabetic order, according to the same principle. The formula for the entire coordina- tion entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in square brackets. In a coordination name, the ligands are listed in alphabetic order, without regard to charge, before the name of the central atom. Numeri- cal prefixes indicating the number of ligands are not considered in determining that order. All anionic  coordination entities take the ending -ate, whereas no distinguishing termination is used for cationic or  neutral coordination entities. "

He was the son of David Croll, a stonemason from Little Whitefield, Perthshire, and Janet Ellis of Elgrin. He received an elementary school education until he was 13 years old.

    "climate": [
        " and creating the ice ages on Earth was due to variations in insolation, which is the rate of delivery of solar radiation per unit of horizontal surface, i.e., the sunlight hitting the Earth. Croll first realized that Adh\u00e9mar did not take into account the shape of the Earth\u2019s orbit that varied over time and its effect on precession, so he calculated the eccentricity over several million years. This eccentricity (the distance between the center of an eccentric and its axis), in this case the degree of Earth\u2019s elliptic orbit, he proposed, varied on a time scale of about 100,000 years. Since variations in eccentricity only produced small changes in the annual radiation budget of Earth, and not enough to force an ice age, Croll developed the idea of climatic feedbacks, such as changes in surface albedo (reflection). He predicted that the last ice age was over about 80,000 years ago. During the 1860s, he published his theories in a number of papers: \u201cOn the Physical Cause of Changes of Climate during Geological Epochs\u201d (1864); \u201cThe Eccentricity of the Earth\u2019s Orbit\u201d (1866, 1867); \u201cGeo- logical Time and Date of Glacial and Miocene Periods\u201d (1868); \u201cThe Physical Cause of the Motion of Glaciers\u201d (1869, 1870); \u201cThe Supposed Greater Loss of Heat by the Southern Hemisphere\u201d (1869); \u201cEvolu- tion by Force Impossible: A New Argument against Materialism\u201d (1877). During this time he was the keep- er of maps and correspondence at the Scottish Geologi- cal Survey starting in 1867, where he mingled with some of the best geologists of the time until he retired in 1880. In 1875 he published  Geological Relations,   research on the ancient condition of the Earth. On Jan- uary 6, 1876, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Soci- ety of London. Charles Darwin was among the many supporters of his nomination. He received an LL.D. (law degree) that year from St. Andrews College. While his main interests were in the field of paleoclimate change, he also put forth theories about ocean currents and their effects on climate during modern times. However, some of his thoughts and ideas were wrong. For example, Croll believed that ice ages varied in the hemispheres, and his estimated age for the last ice advance ending 80,000 to 100,000 years ago was wrong. It ended between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago, as research currently shows. Because of these errors, Croll fell out of vogue until 1912, when Yugoslav geol- ogist Milutin Milankovitch revised Croll\u2019s theories in his book,  Croll published close to 90 papers on a variety of subjects, such as \u201cOcean Currents\u201d (1870, 1871, 1874); \u201cChange of Obliquity of Ecliptic: Its Effect on Climate\u201d (1867); \u201cPhysical Cause of Submergence during Glacial Epoch\u201d (1866, 1874); \u201cBoulder Clay of Caithness & Glaciation of North Sea\u201d (1870); \u201cMethod of Deter- mining Mean Thickness of Sedimentary Rocks\u201d (1871); ", 
        ". Using that information he developed a method to reconstruct climate from past tree rings and to reconstruct spatial arrays of past cli- mate from spatial arrays of tree-ring data. He also developed a biophysical model of tree-ring structure response to daily weather conditions. This work has laid the groundwork for much current dendroclimatic reconstruction work.

There are about 250,000 species of angiosperms around the world. They make up the largest classifica- tion of plants. It is the development of flowers for reproduction that sets them apart from other plant types. Many of our food and economic staples are from angiosperms, e.g., peanuts, flax, spinach, rice, corn, cotton. The class Angiospermae (division Anthophyta) is the largest classification of plants. Its distinctive charac- teristic is the development of flowers, which are used for reproduction. The oldest angiosperm fossils came from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era.

Ehrlich himself had a bout of tuberculosis. Ehrlich also discovered the blood\u2013brain barrier when he noticed that the dyes injected into an animal brain would not stain.

The Karner blue occurs very locally throughout its range, with small clusters of populations living many miles apart. The butterfly was historically known from sites in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, and Ontario. Many locality records are very old, and the butterfly has since been extir- pated in areas such as Brooklyn, in New York City, and the suburbs of Chicago. More recently, Karner blues have died out in New England and from New York City to Illinois along the southern edge of their range, except for northern Indi- ana. The butterfly is presently known to persist naturally only in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the upper Hudson River Valley in New York, with reintroductions attempted in Ohio and planned for several other areas where it formerly lived. The Karner blue\u2019s annual life cycle proceeds like clockwork: the first hatch of Karner blue adults flies in late May and early June, when the lupines bloom. After mating, females lay tiny greenish-white, turban-shaped eggs on lupine plants at the same season. Within a week, minuscule caterpillars hatch from the eggs and begin to feed on lupine leaflets, leaving translucent holes as their unique feeding sign. They are often attended by ants, which feed on a sweet fluid the caterpillars produce in glands on their abdomens, incidentally reducing predation and parasitism. When fully grown three weeks later, the caterpillars are half an inch long, with black heads, velvety green bodies, a dark stripe along their backs, and light stripes along their sides. They crawl off the plant to find a sheltered place in the litter for their chrysalis, which is smooth, bright green, and held to the substrate by a white silken thread around the middle and by microscopic hooks embedded in a silk pad at the tail end. Over the next week the developing butterfly\u2019s wings slowly change from green to white to orange and finally to purplish-blue inside the transparent chrysalis skin. The sec- ond brood of adults hatches from mid-July to early August, and after mating, females again lay eggs on or near the lupine plants, which by now have largely withered. These summer eggs do not hatch until the following April, when new lupine leaves are pushing through the sand. The tiny spring caterpillars grow, pupate, and produce a new brood of butterflies in late May, finishing the cycle of two full broods per year. These dates are for New York State. The timing of this annual calendar may shift a week or two later at the northern and western edges of the butterfly\u2019s range, but the sequence remains the same. Because this butterfly naturally occurred along or near waterways where major human settlements have grown, the Karner blue has been frequently subjected to urbaniza- (continues) ", 
        "s that keep its habitats open and sunny. Without fire, the barrens grow up into forests, shad- ing out open areas the butterflies need for mating, feeding, and egg laying, and reducing the lupine plants that are nec- essary for its caterpillars to survive. Global warming may also be taking its toll: relatively mild winters in the North- east since the early 1970s have reduced or eliminated the annual snowpack that shelters the overwintering eggs from December to March, forcing them to hatch too early, dessi- cate on sunbaked spring sand, or lie exposed to predators and parasitoids during this defenseless life stage. Intensive scientific studies of the Karner blue have been conducted since 1973, when people first realized that it was declining in New York. Private conservation efforts began soon after, starting with the Pine Bush Historic Preservation Project (headed by Don Rittner), the Karner Blue Project (conducted by Robert Dirig and John F.

Spider Barbour of the rock group Chrysalis com- posed the song \u201cShepherd\u2019s Purse\u201d in the 1970s to highlight the butterfly\u2019s plight. After the Karner blue was classified as threatened or endangered in various states, governmental funding became available, and many ecological studies were conducted by professional scientists. Today the Karn- er blue is extremely well known biologically (for example, we know the elemental composition of its eggshell), and the butterfly has also been the subject of several studies of preservation strategies. Habitat conservation efforts have continued at Karner (Albany Pine Bush), where approxi- mately 2,750 acres of the type locality have been preserved to date. Managing this large preserve is challenging, as its location between urban centers discourages the fires that are needed to maintain the open vegetation Karner blues require. Additional preserves have been set aside for the butterfly and its habitat in many places throughout its range. The Xerces Society was founded in 1971 to focus on insect conservation, and initially emphasized imperiled North American butterflies. This group\u2019s scope has broad- ened over the past three decades to include all terrestrial and marine invertebrates, and has had an important, if sub- tle, impact on North American conservation efforts. It is named for the Xerces blue ( nia butterfly similar to the Karner blue that became extinct in the 1940s.

He received a B.S. in chemistry at the Uni- versity of California and later attended Johns Hopkins University to study medicine, receiving an M.D. degree in 1899. He was appointed assistant in the department of physiology at the medical school, after spending a year of hospital training at Johns Hopkins Hospital, until 1906, moving up successively as instructor, associate, and associate professor. He was then appointed the first professor of physiology in the newly established Medical School of the University of Wisconsin. In 1910 he was appointed professor of physiology in the reorganized Medical School of the Washington University, St. Louis, retiring in 1946 as chairman of the school. In 1922, in collaboration with his student Herbert Gasser, Erlanger adapted the cathode-ray oscillograph for the study of nerve-action potentials. They ampli- fied the electrical responses of single nerve fibers and analyzed them by the use of the oscilloscope. The characteristic wave pattern of an impulse generated in a stimulated nerve fiber could be observed on the screen and the components of the nerve\u2019s response studied. Erlanger and Gasser were given the Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology in 1944 for this work.

For the expression of metalloproteins, usually other gene products will be required. extended X-ray absorption fine structure  (EXAFS)  EXAFS effects arise because of electron scattering by atoms surrounding a particular atom of interest as that special atom absorbs X rays and emits electrons. The atom of interest absorbs photons at a characteristic wavelength, and the emitted electrons, undergoing con- structive or destructive interference as they are scat- tered by the surrounding atoms, modulate the absorption spectrum. The modulation frequency corre- sponds directly to the distance of the surrounding atoms, while the amplitude is related to the type and number of atoms. EXAFS studies are a probe of the local structure. EXAFS can be applied to systems that have local structure, but not necessarily long-range structure, such as noncrystalline materials. In particu- lar, bond lengths and local symmetry ( COORDINATION numbers) can be derived. The X-ray absorption spec- trum can also show detailed structure below the absorption edge. This X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) arises from excitation of core elec- trons to high-level vacant orbitals. "

    "Florentine thermometers": [
        ", or any thermometers of the time, were not very accurate; no two thermometers gave the same temperature, since there was no universal acceptance of liquid type or agreement on what to use for a scale. Makers of Flo- rentine thermometers marked the low end of the scale as the coldest day in Florence that year and the high end of the scale as the hottest day. Because tempera- ture fluctuations naturally occur over the years, no two thermometers gave the same temperature. For sev- eral years Fahrenheit experimented with this problem, finally devising an accurate alcohol thermometer in 1709 and the first mercury or \u201cquicksilver\u201d ther- mometer in 1714. Fahrenheit\u2019s first thermometers, from about 1709 to 1715, contained a column of alcohol that directly expanded and contracted, based on a design made by Danish astronomer Olaus Romer in 1708, which Fahren- heit personally reviewed. Romer used alcohol (actually wine) as the liquid, but his thermometer had two fixed reference points. He selected 60 degrees for the tempera- ture of boiling water and 7.5 degrees for melting ice. Fahrenheit eventually devised a temperature scale for his alcohol thermometers with three points calibrated at 32 degrees for freezing water, 96 degrees for body temperature (based on the thermometer being in a healthy man\u2019s mouth or under the armpit), and zero degrees fixed at the freezing point of ice and salt, believed at the time to be the coldest possible tempera- ture. The scale was etched in 12 major points (with zero, four, and 12 as three points) and eight gradations between the major points, giving him a total of 96 points for his scale for body temperature on his thermometer. Because his thermometers showed such consistency in their measurements, mathematician Christian Wolf at Halle, Prussia, devoted a whole paper in an edition of   national journals of the time, on two of Fahrenheit\u2019s thermometers that were given to him in 1714. From 1682 until it ceased publication in 1731, the Latin  Eruditorum,   ported by the duke of Saxony, was one of the most important international journals. The periodical was founded by Otto Mencke, professor of morals and practical philosophy, and mathematician Gottfried Wil- helm Leibnitz. Written in Latin, the journal covered sci- ence and social science and was primarily a vehicle for reviewing books. In 1724 Fahrenheit published a paper, \u201cExperimenta circa gradum caloris liquorum nonnullo- rum ebullientium instituta (Experiments done on the degree of heat of a few boiling liquids), in the Royal Society\u2019s publication  was admitted to the Royal Society the same year. Fahrenheit decided to substitute mercury for the alcohol because its rate of expansion was more con- stant than that of alcohol and could be used over a wider range of temperatures. Fahrenheit, like  ISAAC NEWTON before him, realized that it was more accurate to base the thermometer on a substance that changed consistently based on temperature instead of simply on 124  "

An unsaturated fatty acid is a long-chain car- boxylic acid that contains one or more carbon  C=C double bonds. They occur when all of the  carbons in a chemical chain are not saturated with hydrogen, so that the fat molecule contains one or more double bonds and produces a fat that is fluid at room temperature.

The number and location of double bonds also vary for the different fatty acids. More than 70 different kinds have been found in cells. Saturated fatty acids have higher levels of blood cholesterol, since they have a regulating effect on its synthesis, but unsaturated ones do not have that effect and thus they are more often promoted nutrition- ally. Some fatty acids are palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eleostearic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and elaidic acid. Three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule form fat. "

Fleming was interested in the natural bacterial action of the blood and in antiseptics, and he worked on antibacterial substances that would not be toxic to animal tissues. In 1921 he discovered an important bacteriolytic substance that he named lysozyme. In 1928 he made his most important discovery while working on an influenza virus. He noticed that mold had developed accidentally on a staphylococcus culture plate and that the mold had created a bacteria-free cir- cle around itself.

Secreted enzymes help aid in the digestion of the fluids. Piercing by insects typically involves the use of a proboscis formed by the maxillae and composed of two canals. The first canal carries in the prey\u2019s blood, and the other delivers saliva and anticoagulants. The cutting-and-licking technique is used by black flies and vampire bats, who cut the prey\u2019s body with teeth or sharp mouthparts and then lick the fluids while injecting anticoagulants to prevent clotting.

The ligand gated ion channel receptor is a signal receptor protein in a cell membrane that can act as a channel for the passage of a specific ion across the membrane. When activated by a signal molecule, it allows or blocks the passage of the ion. This results in a change in ion con- centration that often affects cell functioning. ",

He also mar- ried Donna Lina, a niece of Bizzozero. Golgi developed an interest in the causes of malaria and determined the three forms of the parasite and their associated fevers. He developed a photographic technique to document the most characteristic phases of malaria in 1890. While Golgi never practiced medicine, he was a famous and popular teacher as director of the Depart- ment of General Pathology at St. Matteo Hospital. He also founded and directed the Instituto Sieroterapico- Vaccinogeno of the Province of Pavia. Golgi also became rector of Pavia University and was made a sen- ator of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War I, he assumed the responsibility for a military hospital in Pavia and created a neu- ropathological and mechanotherapeutical center for the study and treatment of peripheral nervous lesions and for the rehabilitation of the wounded.

In other words, in the absence of any of these factors, the allele frequencies and the frequencies of the different genotypes will remain the same from one generation to the next, and genetic recombination due to sexual reproduction will not result in any changes in allele frequencies or geno- type frequencies. harelip  (cleft lip)  A congenital (birth) deformity caused by a failure of developing tissues to fuse; a cleft in the upper lip, found on one or both sides of the mid- line.

Another exotic introduction, the Asian ladybug ( 1990s and has partially displaced the previously introduced seven-spotted ladybug. It is now somewhat of a rarity to see a native ladybug in New York State. The level at which the various ladybugs compete is not that well understood. The nine-spotted and the seven-spotted are very close relatives, so the fact that they compete directly should not have surprised scientists. What is more surprising is that the distantly related Asian ladybug displaced the nine-spotted and many others, despite the lack of any close relationship. Parasites and diseases of introduced insects are some of the baggage that comes with these introductions. The introductions have evolved a resistance or at least a tolerance to these coevolved agents to which our native species have never been exposed. It is smallpox at an insect level. All the aforementioned ladybugs eat aphids, but they can be particular about which species and in what habitats. The diversity of native ladybug species was achieved through natural selection. Introductions upset the balance. We can never take back the dozens of introduced ladybugs. If all life (not just ladybugs) from all of the earth\u2019s conti- nents were mixed together tomorrow, it would result in a die-off of diversity that would parallel that of the Devonian extinction that occurred millions of years ago. This is what we are doing, albeit slowly, with accidental and purposeful introductions. Once an undesirable exotic has gained a foothold, we are caught up in a cycle of introducing preda- tors, parasitoids, and diseases in an attempt to suppress or eradicate the original introduction.

The curved hook was twisted repeatedly to macerate the brain, which was removed piecemeal through the nose.

After this they fill the cavity with the purest bruised myrrh, with cassia, and every sort of spice except frankincense, and sew up the opening. Then the body is placed in natrum for 70 days and covered entire- ly over. After the expiration of this space of time, which must not be exceeded, the body is washed, and wrapped round, from head to foot, with bandages of fine linen cloth, smeared over with gum, which is used generally by the Egyptians in the place of glue, and in this state it is given back to the relations, who enclose it in a wooden case which they have made for this purpose, and shaped into the figure of a man. Then fastening the case, they place it in a sepulchral chamber, upright against the wall. Such is the most costly way of embalming the dead.\u201d Herodotus\u2019s account has been confirmed as basically accurate by modern analysis of Egyptian mummies. Mum- mification evolved considerably during the 2,000 years from its beginning in the Old Kingdom to the time described by Herodotus. All internal organs except the heart, which was considered the seat of emotions and intellect, were removed to prevent decomposition and putrefaction.

        ". The society, also known as The Royal Society of Lon- don for Improving Natural Knowledge, was founded on November 28, 1660, to discuss the latest develop- ments in science, philosophy, and the arts. The found- ing fathers, consisting of 12 men, began after a lecture by Christopher Wren at Gresham College. The group included Wren, Boyle, John Wilkins, Sir Robert Moray, and William Brouncker. This position gave Hooke a unique opportunity to familiarize himself with the lat- est progress in science. Part of Hooke\u2019s job was to demonstrate and lecture on several experiments at the Royal Society at each weekly meeting. This led him to many observations and inventions in a number of fields, including astrono- my, physics, and meteorology. He excelled at this job, and in 1663 Hooke was elected a fellow of the society, becoming not just an employee but on equal footing with the other members. Hooke took advantage of his experience and posi- tion. He invented the first reflecting telescope, the spi- ral spring in watches, an iris diaphragm for telescopes (now used in cameras instead), the universal joint, the first screw-divided quadrant, a compound microscope, an odometer, a wheel-cutting machine, a hearing aid, a new type of glass, and carriage improvements. Despite all of these accomplishments, he remains one of the most neglected scientists, due to his argumentative style and the apparent retribution by his enemies such as Newton. Hooke became a professor of physics at Gresham College in 1665 and stayed there for his entire life. It was also where the Royal Society met until after his death. Hooke also served as the society\u2019s secretary from 1677 to 1683. The year 1665 is another milestone year for Hooke, since that is when he published his major work Micrographia,   where he demonstrated his remarkable powers of observation and his skillful microscopic investigation in the fields of botany, chemistry, and meteorology. With- in this work, he made many acute observations, illus- trated with intricate drawings, and proposed several theories. Hooke was the first to discover plant cells and he coined the word  structure of cork, although he failed to realize that cells were the basic units of life. He made detailed observa- tions, some of the first, on insects, sponges, bryozoans, foraminifera, and even birds. He was the first to exam- ine fossils under a microscope and concluded that many fossils represented organisms that no longer existed on Earth. Because of his controversies\u2014he had competing claims with Christian Huyghens over the invention of the spring regulator and with Newton, first over optics (1672) and, second, over the formulation of the inverse square law of gravitation (1686)\u2014Hooke fell out of favor in the scientific community. He died in London on March 3, 1703, and was buried in Bishopsgate. How- ever, sometime in the 19th century his bones were removed, and no one knows where he is buried today. "

His father was a bar- rister. Houssay\u2019s early education was at a private school, the Colegio Brit\u00e1nico. He then entered the School of Pharmacy of the University of Buenos Aires at the age of 14, graduating in 1904. He had already begun studying medicine and, in 1907, before complet- ing his studies, took up a post in the department of physiology and began research that resulted in his receiving an M.D. in 1911. In 1910 he was appointed professor of physiology in the university\u2019s school of veterinary medicine. In 1919 he became professor of physiology in the medical school at Buenos Aires University and also organized the Institute of Physiology at the medical school, mak- ing it a center with an international reputation. He remained professor and director of the institute until 1943, when the government then in power deprived him of his post, the result of his voicing the opinion that there should be effective democracy in the coun- try. In 1955 a new government reinstated him in the university. He demonstrated that a hormone secreted by the pituitary prevented metabolism of sugar and that injec- tions of pituitary extract induced symptoms of dia- betes. He was awarded the 1947 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work on the functions of the "

        ". The adenohypophysis secretes FSH (follicle- stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), TSH (thyroid- stimulating hormone), GH (growth hormone), and prolactin. The neurohypophysis, or the posterior lobe of the pituitary, is connected to the hypothalamus by the stalklike infundibulum and receives two hormones released by the neurons in the hypothalamus, oxy- tocin (OT) and vasopressin or ADH (antidiuretic hor- mone). Oxytocin and ADH are stored in the posterior pituitary. The neurohypophysis is an outgrowth of nervous tissue from the floor of the brain in the region of the hypothalamus. It is made up of the pars ner- vosa and is connected to the brain by the infundibu- lum. Oxytocin acts on myoepithelial cells in the mammary glands and uterine muscles, causing both to contract. ADH stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb more water. The hypothalamus contains mammillary bodies, the median eminence, and infundibulum. It contains nuclei that produce the neurohormones. In the supraoptic region are cell bodies of neurons in the par- aventricular nucleus that synthesize oxytocin, while those in the supraoptic nucleus synthesize ADH. Neurosecretory cells are also found in other ani- mals such as mollusks, nematodes, and platy- helminthes, to name a few. neurosecretory cells  243 ",

An example of this is the scientist who stated that she would consider the possible existence of a soul\u2014as soon as they deter- mined the part of the brain that provided communication with the soul. Most people believe that they have a soul and con- sider the issues of life after death, the existence and nature of God, and the meaning of life. Religious beliefs and values enable them to relate to the unknown with ben- efit to their personal values, conduct, and happiness. However, most scientists by their indifference and skepti- cism have tended to undermine the value of faith and treat it as superstition. In these matters, hypotheses that cannot be proved or disproved should be judged, or at least acknowledged of value, by the results in the lives of individuals who practice their faith. The one belief that science has mathematically proved is the existence and benefit of love. (See Von Foerster, Heinz.   Representation.   Love can thus provide the test of hypotheses about phe- nomena of mind and spirit that presently defy explanation. So now ultimate questions about reality, which remain pro- found mysteries that cannot be approached by scientific measurements or methods, can nevertheless be recognized and pursued through articles of faith and practice. If reality is consistent, then the truth and the value of a faith or belief can be judged by the increase and depth of love\u2014or cre- ative altruism\u2014in the lives of those who practice at belief. Prayer to a personal God and practice of the Sermon on the Mount has inspired personal love and courage and led to great peaceful changes for social freedom and jus- tice. (See  and  Science must no longer negate the values of religious belief, but rather strengthen and support the importance of faith\u2014of using the personal metaphor that increases the well-being of the individual, that deepens relationships with people and kinship with life on Earth. The scientific approach can at the same time dimin- ish religious intolerance by calling attention to the nature of metaphor or hypothesis. A hypothesis can be exciting and useful and obtain confidence from its supporters who may totally believe in its validity. Nevertheless, by its nature there must be, and can be, recognition and respect for people with a different hypothesis about reality. Where approval for a different religious or philosophical doctrine may be impossible, there still can be deep approval of the love that is motivated and demonstrated in connection with it. The scientific community should also give importance to any phenomenon that greatly affects human values and potentials, even though scientific explanation eludes its grasp. There is overwhelming evidence of answered prayer in the lives of many people. The incidence of favorable coin- cidence in deeply dedicated people who pray with fervor and faith should be studied and compared with other people who practice a purely psychological approach to needs. The nature and extent of coincidences that run contrary to probability theory should be more thoroughly explored. Per- haps there is no satisfactory explanation possible. But this should not cause science to ignore the phenomenon or its causes and effects in the lives of people. Of course, scientists would make a careful distinction between a phenomenon and its effects, on the other hand, explaining what it is and how it works. Great benefit could come from more attention to phenomenology and the many instances of its effects on the lives of people. The nature and extent of spiritual healing should be more critically examined. While success seems a random effect that is rare, many proven cases defy medical explanation. By its very nature, any effort to make Earth a healthy, peaceful planet must be achieved through a great spiritual awakening of a kind that will foster the nurture and care of Earth and a creative happy life for all its people. \u2014John McConnell   of Earth Day; his new program for saving Earth is called the Earth Trustee Agenda (www.earthsite.org)."

Can be cleaved into a peptide involved in cell death (apoptosis). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is produced by T helper and suppresser lymphocytes. IL-2 increases the expression of natural killer and other cytotoxic cells and stimulates helper T cells to proliferate more rapidly. IL-2 is produced commercial- ly by recombinant DNA technology and used for the treatment of metastatic renal (i.e., kidney) cell cancer. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is released by lymphocytes (TH-2 subset of T helper lymphocytes) and promotes anti- body production by stimulating B cells to proliferate and mature and promotes allergic responses via pro- duction of the immunoglobulin IgE. Interleukin-6 (IL- 6) affects many different cells in the immune system by inducing differentiation and activation. Inter- leukin-10 (IL-10), like IL-4, is released by lympho- cytes (the TH-2 subset of T helper lymphocytes). IL-10 enhances the humoral response and increases antibody production. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) induces the production of natural killer and other cytotoxic immune cells. "

    "Koch, Robert": [
        "  (1843\u20131910) German  Robert Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in Clausthal in the Upper Harz Mountains and is consid- ered one of the fathers of modern medical bacteriolo- gy (along with Louis Pasteur). The son of a mining engineer, he taught himself to read by age five. He attended the local high school and developed an inter- est in biology. In 1862 Koch attended the University of G\u00f6ttingen to study medicine under professor of anatomy Jacob Henle. In 1840 Henle had published that living, para- sitic organisms caused infectious diseases. In 1866 Koch married Emmy Fraats and they had one daughter. After receiving his M.D. degree, Koch went to Berlin for further study. In 1867, after a period as assistant in the general hospital at Hamburg, he settled into general practice at Langenhagen and, in 1869, at Rackwitz, in the province of Posen. There he passed his district med- ical officer\u2019s examination, but in 1870 he volunteered to serve in the Franco-Prussian War. From 1872 to 1880 he was district medical officer for Wollstein and while there carried out his groundbreaking research. Studying from his four-room flat, with a micro- scope and other equipment he purchased, he began research on anthrax, earlier discovered by other scien- tists to be caused by a bacillus. Koch wanted to prove whether or not anthrax was actually caused by the bacillus, and he used mice and bacilli taken from the spleens of dead farm animals. He found that the mice did die from the bacillus and proved that the blood of anthrax-infected animals transmitted it. He also showed that the bacilli could produce resistance spores when environmental conditions were unfavorable, and that they could reemerge as viable anthrax-causing organ- isms when conditions changed. Koch\u2019s work became internationally known when it was published in 1876. He was the first person to establish a definite causal connection between a particular disease and a particular bacillus. He continued working on methods of studying bacteria and in 1878 published his results that included how to control infections caused by bacteria. In 1880 he was appointed a member of the Reichs- Gesundheitsamt (Imperial Health Bureau) in Berlin and continued to refine his methods in bacteriological research. He invented new methods of cultivating pure cultures of bacteria on solid media and on agar kept in the special kind of flat dish invented by his colleague Petri, which is still in common use (the Petri dish). He also developed new methods of staining bacteria, mak- ing them easily visible for identification. All of this work helped establish the methods to study pathogenic bacteria easily in pure cultures. Koch also laid down the conditions, known as Koch\u2019s postulates, that must be satisfied before it can be accepted that particular bacte- ria cause particular diseases. These postulates were: \u2022 The specific organism should be shown to be present in every case of the disease. \u2022 The specific microorganism should be isolated from the diseased animal and grown in pure culture on artificial laboratory media such as in a Petri dish. \u2022 The freshly isolated microorganism, when inoculated into a healthy laboratory animal, should cause the same disease seen in the original animal. \u2022 The microorganism should be recovered from the experimentally infected animal. Koch also discovered the tubercle bacillus, the cause of tuberculosis, and developed a method of growing it in pure culture, and in 1882, he published his now classical work on the bacillus. In 1883 he was sent to Egypt as leader of the German Cholera Com- mission to investigate a "

In 1909 he received the Nobel Prize for this work and donated the prize money to create a research institute. Kocher devised many new surgical techniques, instruments, and appliances that carry his name, such as forceps (Kocher and Ochsner/Kocher forceps, Kocher tweez- ers), Kocher incision (in gallbladder surgery), the Kocher vein (thyroid), Kocherization (surgery tech- nique), and Kocher\u2019s test (for thyroid-tracheomalacia).

In 1880 Laveran examined blood samples from malarial patients and discovered amoebalike organisms growing within red blood cells, and he noticed that they divided, formed spores, and invaded unaffected blood cells. He also noted that the spores were released in each affected red cell at the same time and corre- sponded with a fresh attack of fever in the patient. His researches confirmed that the blood parasites that he had described were in fact the cause of malaria, but his first publications on the malaria parasites were received with skepticism until scientists around the world pub- lished confirmative research results.

In this work by Spanish physician Nicol\u00e1s Monardes, we are told of the use of sassafras root bark for fever, liver discomfort, headache, bronchial congestion, stomach ailments, kidney stones, gout, toothache, arthritis, constipation, and infertility. Sassafras root bark became a principal export to Europe, second only to tobacco. Sassafras is a member of the family Lauraceae, which comprises approximately 40 genera and more than 2,000 species. Besides sassafras, other familiar members include the cinnamon trees of the Orient, the West Indian avocado pear, and spicebush. Early accounts of New World explorers cite enormous populations of the sas- safras tree along the entire Eastern Seaboard. Our native sassafras occurs from Maine to Michigan, and south to Florida and Texas. Sassafras oil possesses a sweet, woody flavor and was widely employed to flavor toothpaste and soft drinks, particularly root beer, prior to 1960. It was discovered to be a carcinogen and banned from products after 1960. A hallu- cinogenic drug known as Ecstasy is derived from safrole, a secondary plant substance obtained from the roots of sas- safras. Today, sassafras tea, produced by steeping the young roots, remains a fixture in Appalachian folk culture as a \u201cspring tonic\u201d and \u201cblood thinner.\u201d There are an estimated 100,000\u2013400,000 different sec- ondary compounds in plants. Secondary plant substances are those products not known to have any function in plant growth or metabolism. They were once thought to represent waste or by-products of plant metabolism. Current thinking associates these substances with chemical defenses against herbivores. Ironically, these same plant chemicals sometimes provide the herbivore with protection: monarch ",

Strikingly few lepidopterans have secondarily adapted to sassafras.

Later, in the middle 19th century, commercial silk production was promoted in Europe and North America as a viable industry, but startups in the Unit- ed States, mostly along the east and west coasts, proved too costly against foreign competition, bringing American sericulture to an early end. Its legacy remains, however, in the form of one lovely moth and its host plant, and in the form of an unlovely moth that haunts the Northeast to this day. A major silk promoter, the Frenchman L\u00e9opold Trou- velot, imported both moths in the 1860s.

Though tree-of-heaven is widespread in disturbed portions of rural areas (along highways and power-line cuts, for example), the moth is never found in these wilder places, only in sooty railroad yards, unkempt used car lots and junk yards, and similar sites.

The authors, two New Englanders named Ida Eliot and Caroline Soule, gave detailed accounts of raising 43 species of moths, most of them native to the eastern United States. Among their successes was a cross-pairing with viable but infertile hybrid offspring between species of two different genera, the spicebush silk moth ( promethea  Samia cynthia  Intergeneric hybrids are very rare.

The Amateur Entomologists\u2019 Society, a British organi- zation, published a compendium of moth-breeding methods in its sixth volume in 1942, edited by Beowulf Cooper. The material in this issue of the AES journal was revised and expanded by W. J. B.

Screen-topped containers allow air to circulate, but this causes leaves placed in the containers to dry out, so the caterpillars don\u2019t get enough water. Closed containers have sufficient air for several days at least, but this lack of ventilation produces condensation, creating a breeding ground for fungal and bacterial dis- eases. Open-weave cloth bags (\u201csleeves\u201d in moth breeder parlance), placed over tree limbs and tied tight around the branch at the open end, guarantee fresh food and fresh air but are subject to attack by birds and wasps, which can peck or chew holes in the sleeves and consume the help- less caterpillars in short order. Beginners can expect to raise at least several species of silk moth everywhere except in an extremely cold, polar climate. Caterpillars of many species feed on a much wider range of plants than those they feed upon in their native habitats; even some exotic species can be reared on plant genera common almost everywhere, such as oak, apple, willow, and privet.

Obtaining fertile eggs is simple enough, once one has collected a few cocoons. Chances are, in a batch of six or more cocoons, at least one will produce a female. Fresh males and females may mate overnight in an amply sized screen cage. Lacking males, a female may be teth- ered on a string tied around the thorax between the wings, tied in an open-ended screen cylinder for protec- tion from predators, and left in a tree or shrub overnight. Very likely in the morning there will be a male mating with her, the female having emitted her seductive perfume (a chemical attractant called a pheromone) during the night. Unlike butterflies, most of which cannot be induced to lay eggs on anything but fresh leaves of a specific plant species, silk moths will lay eggs on anything. Most breed- ers place a fertilized female in a paper shopping bag (plastic will not do), and the moth will lay eggs on the sides of the bag. The bag can be cut into pieces with eggs firmly attached, and placed on appropriate host", 
        " in wild or weedy areas near home. To the sharp- eyed, a winter walk may yield cocoons hanging from tree twigs, spun among the shoots at the bases of maple and poplar trees, or hidden in tangles of shrubbery. In summer and fall, one can locate caterpillars by looking for missing leaves (nibbled down to the stem) on trees and shrubs, or checking bare ground or pavement under tree branches for caterpillar droppings (\u201cfrass\u201d). Once one has female moths, either from discovered cocoons or caterpillars or from pur- chased stock, one can attract local wild males by tethering the females overnight. It is advisable to purchase a stan- dard work on moth culture before embarking on such an adventure. A patchwork of open and forested land is probably the best place to look for caterpillars and cocoons, the more varied the better. Wetlands will have different species than mature forests, farm hedgerows, weedy lots, or wind-swept ridges. Silk moths are known to tolerate a fairly high degree of disturbance and tend to prefer \u201cedge habitats.\u201d Roadsides, railroad rights-of-way, utility corri- dors, and even unkempt, weedy corners of industrial yards are tried and true places for collecting wild silk moths in all developmental stages. Even cities have scattered, unmanicured corners where moths eke out a living. The ailanthus silk moth is one saturniid species that country- dwelling silk moth enthusiasts must visit a city to find. In the same urban setting reside several of the native silk moths, particularly cecropia, polyphemus, and promethea. During the early 20th century, many authors reported these species as abundant in eastern and midwestern cities, the caterpillars and cocoons regularly discovered by schoolchildren and curious nature lovers on shade plantings. Toward the end of the century, especially in the 1990s, observers of silk moths reported significant declines and apparent disappearances of common species from urban and suburban areas in many areas of the eastern states. The causes for these declines are uncertain, but the following factors have been suggested: increased lighting at night (which may interfere with reproductive behavior), the release of nonnative parasites to control gypsy moth and other pests, and general increased use and accumulation of insecticides and other toxic chemicals. Though certain species of silk moths may be common in settled areas, few ever become sufficiently populous to be considered pests.

Most adult silk moths do not eat at all, having built up an ample supply of fat reserves in the caterpillar stage. Silk moth caterpillars are eating machines, growing from tiny hatchlings smaller than rice grains into fat sausagelike creatures, the largest the size of fingers. Most feed on leaves or some other plant material, tending to move from branch to branch, eating a leaf here and a leaf there, in order to avoid consuming their cover and camouflage. After feeding, some species burrow into the ground or simply crawl under a sheltering object, molting one last time to form the sleeping pupa, a limbless ovoid or cylindrical thing, capable of nothing more than wiggling and twisting.

In time, however, more sophisticated, assembly-line-style rearing techniques were developed in which caterpillars were reared en masse indoors in containers. Only one species of silk moth, the mulberry silkworm moth ( has been completely domesticated. This species appears to have been selectively bred for rearing the caterpillars on flat screen trays stacked in tiers, an extremely space- efficient means of production. Over time, silk producers developed caterpillars lacking the velcrolike ends of the abdominal legs (called \u201cprolegs,\u201d as they are not true legs), so that they did not crawl off the breeding trays, but stayed there feeding as long as they were supplied with leaves.

In addition, their tolerance and accumulation of metals, including heavy metals and radioactive isotopes, are useful indi- cators of industrial pollution.

Between 1917 and 1922 he was educated at the Universities of Koenigsberg, Berlin, and Munich, where he studied medicine and received an M.D. degree in 1924 at Berlin. In 1926 he was an assistant in Otto MEYERHOF \u2019s laboratory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Berlin, and received a Ph.D. in 1927. He then went with Meyerhof to Heidelberg to conduct research on the biochemical reactions occurring in muscle. In 1930 Lipmann went back to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and then to a new institute in Copenhagen in 1932. Between 1931 and 1932 he served as a Rockefeller fellow at the Rockefeller Insti- tute in New York and identified serine phosphate as the constituent of phosphoproteins that contains the phosphate. He went to Copenhagen in 1932 as a research associate in the Biological Institute of the Carlsberg Foundation. In 1939 he came to America and became research associate in the department of biochemistry at Cornell Medical School, New York, and in 1941 joined the research staff of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, first as a research associate in the department of surgery, then heading his own group in the Biochemical Research Laboratory of the hospital. In 1944 he became an American citizen. In 1949 he became professor of biological chemistry at Harvard Medical School, Boston. In 1957 he was appointed a member and professor of the Rockefeller Institute, New York. In 1947 he isolated and named coenzyme A (or CoA). He later determined the molecular structure (1953) of this factor that is now known to be bound to acetic acid as the end product of sugar and fat break- down in the absence of oxygen. It is one of the most important substances involved in cellular metabolism, since it helps in converting amino acids, steroids, fatty acids, and hemoglobins into energy. For his discovery of this coenzyme he was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. He died on July 24, 1986, in Poughkeepsie, New York. "

After spending a few months working in the bio- chemical institute of Franz Hofmeister in Strassburg, he became an assistant to Carl von Noorden, clinician at the city hospital in Frankfurt during 1897\u201398. In 1898 he became an assistant of Professor Hans Horst Meyer, a renowned pharmacologist at the University of Marburg-an-der-Lahn and a professor of pharmacolo- gy in Vienna. In 1905 Loewi became associate profes- sor at Meyer\u2019s laboratory, and in 1909 he was appointed to the chair of pharmacology in Graz. In 1940 he moved to the United States and became research professor at the School of Medicine of New York University, New York City, where he remained until his death.

After two and a half years of experimentation, on August 20, 1897, Ross finally succeeded in demonstrating the life cycle of the parasites of malaria in mosquitoes. He dubbed it \u201cMosquito Day.\u201d In 1898 he demonstrated the malar- ial parasite (plasmodium) in the stomach of the anopheles mosquito, and the following year, Ross joined the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine under the direction of Sir Alfred Jones and was sent  to West Africa to continue his investigations. There  he found the species of mosquitoes that convey the deadly African fever. In 1901 Ross was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and also a fellow of the Royal Society (became vice president from 1911 to 1913). In 1902 His Majesty the King of Great Britain appointed him a companion of the Most Hon- orable Order of Bath. In 1911 he was elevated to  the rank of knight commander of the same order. In Belgium, he was made an officer in the Order of Leopold II. In 1902 the School of Tropical Medicine founded a chair of tropical medicine in University College. The Sir Alfred Jones\u2019 Chair of Tropical Medicine, as it was called, was given to Ross in 1902, which he retained until 1912. He left Liverpool and was appointed physician for tropical diseases at Kings College Hospi- tal, London, a post that he held together with the chair of tropical sanitation in Liverpool. He stayed until 1917, when he was appointed consultant in malariology to the War Office. He was elevated to  the rank of knight commander, St. Michael and  St. George, in 1918 and was later appointed consul- tant in malaria to the Ministry of Pensions. In 1926 he assumed the post of director-in-chief of the Ross Institute and Hospital of Tropical Diseases and Hygiene. His admirers created the institute, and he remained there until his death. He was also a presi- dent of the Society of Tropical Medicine. While his contributions were in the form of the discovery of the transmission of malaria by mosquitoes, he also found time to write poetry and plays and to paint. His poetic works gained him  wide acclamation independent of his medical and mathematical standing. He received many honors in addition to receiving the Nobel Prize in 1902 for his work in malaria, and was given honorary membership of learned societies of most countries of Europe and of many other conti- nents. He received an honorary M.D. degree in Stock- holm in 1910 at the centenary celebration of the Caroline Institute. He was knighted in 1911. His wife died in 1931. Ross died the following year, after a long illness, at the Ross Institute, London, on September 16, 1932, and was buried next to his wife. rough ER  Rough endoplasmic reticulum, the system of membranous interconnected folded sheets in the cytoplasm of cells and in which ribosomes are con- tained.

Those parts were named \u201corganizer center\u201d or \u201corganizer\u201d by him. The so-called organizer effect was the dominant topic in embryological research during the 1930s, and for this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935.

In 1908 he was awarded, together with Paul  EHRLICH , the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. He later proved that syphilis can be transmitted to monkeys and took up the study of the flora (lactic- acid-producing bacteria) of the human intestine  and developed a theory that senility is due to poison- ing of the body by the products of certain of these bacteria. Mechnikov received many distinctions, among which were the honorary D.Sc. of the University of Cambridge, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society  of which he was a foreign member, the honorary memberships of the Academy of Medicine in Paris and the Academies of Sciences and of Medicine in St. Petersburg.

Radiation can be nonionizing (infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, electromagnetic) or ionizing (alpha, beta, gamma, and X rays). Ionizing radiation can have severe effects on human health, but it is also used in medical diagnostic equipment and can be used to provide a host of other economic  benefits from electrical power generation to smoke detectors.

E .) but did not reach its zenith until around 1000  B . C . E . The underlying goal of mummification was to preserve the physical form of the deceased person so that his soul or  body and be united with it in the hereafter. Mummification was practiced by various ancient cultures, including the Incas of South America, but the technique was perfected in ancient Egypt, where funeral houses dotted the Nile River from the Mediterranean Sea to the ancient city of Thebes. The Egyptians believed that after death the body must be intact and have a proper burial for resurrection. Instead of cremation, the bodies were prepared to enter the here- after as \u201cwhole\u201d as possible. During the early dynasties, mummification was a burial form reserved for kings, but by 1000  B . C . E . the practice had become widespread. The pharaohs had the most elaborate burials because it was believed that they became gods after death. High-ranking officials, priests, nobles, and wealthy individuals also underwent mummification. Mummification was not practiced in prehistoric times, when the dead were simply buried in desert pits. The Egyp- tians realized that bodies were preserved naturally in the dry, hot sands of the Egyptian desert. The remains of buried individuals were recognizable many years later. According to renowned Egyptologist Bob Brier, \u201cThe Egyptians started burying their dead in chambers cut into moist bedrock beneath the sand in order to protect the bodies from rob- bers or from being uncovered by the shifting desert sands. Without contact with the dehydrating hot sands, they were subject to decay. This probably gave the Egyptians the impetus to invent mummification.\u201d While Egyptians left very little in written documents about the process of mummification, Egyptologists have been able to unlock many of its mysteries with detailed analysis of human mummies.

His father was a congregational minister with various pas- torates in Wisconsin and Oregon. Parry was educated at the public schools of Wisconsin and Oregon and received a B.A. at the University of Oregon in 1914. From 1915 to 1917, he taught physics and mathe- matics at Oregon high schools and spent one year at the University of Oregon Medical School at Portland, where he also acted as a laboratory assistant in the 232  M\u00fcllerian mimicry  Photograph of the partially uncovered mummy at the Albany Insti-  tute of History and Art (AIHA) in Albany, New York.

The arms are crossed in the typical burial pattern, and there is no  defect in the skull because the brain had been removed through  the nose. Numerous layers of linen wrapping are visible at the  waist. Hieroglyphics on his coffin bear the name of Ankhefenmut  and identify him as a priest from the temple of Mut at Karnak in  Thebes (according to Ms. Bethyl Mayer, who did background  research on the two Albany mummies).

This salt worked by absorbing water from the inter- nal organs, muscles, and blood before microbial action and decomposition could begin. Once the process of enzymatic decomposition of protein begins, there is production of foul- smelling compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and mercaptans. The tissues decompose and rot away. When the organs were sufficiently dried out, they were placed into ornamental burial jars usually made of lime- stone. These were called \u201c", 
        ", a naturally occurring salt composed of sodium car- bonate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium chloride (table salt). The two chief sources of natron in ancient Egypt were El Kab, a city in Upper Egypt, and the Wadi Natrun, an area just outside Cairo.

A groove in the dependent end of the table allowed the fluids to drain off. The human body is about 70 percent water, and during mummification there is considerable loss of weight due to loss of water. It was very likely that embalming took place outside in a tent, which allowed better ventilation. Anubis, the jackal-headed god of embalming, is often referred to as being \u201cin his tent.\u201d Once the body was dehydrated, the abdominal and chest cavities were then washed with palm oil and aromatic spices.

Finally the corpse was wrapped in numerous turns of linen bandages. Laid out end-to-end, the linen would measure hundreds of yards long. At the time of burial the body was adorned with gold, jewels, and amulets. The amulets were prescribed by the Book of the Dead and were supposed to aid the deceased on his journey to the underworld. These valuable objects, which were placed beneath the wrappings, would become the targets of grave robbers over the ensuing centuries. The coating resin imparted a dark color to the skin  of the mummies. Foreign travelers to Egypt mistakenly assumed that the blackened, solidified resin covering the mummies was bitumen, the mineral formed from pitch. Since the major source of bitumen was a mountain in Persia  (Iran), where the substance was called \u201cmummia,\u201d these embalmed bodies eventually became known as \u201cmummies.\u201d The process of mummification has been studied for centuries. Visual inspection necessitates that the mummy be unwrapped from its burial cloth. Anatomic dissection of a mummy results in the irrevocable destruction of the \u201cintact body\u201d and violates the ancient Egyptians\u2019 desire to remain whole in the hereafter. With the advent of the X ray, mummies could be studied without destroying or even dis- turbing them.

CT provides excellent detail of the inside of a mummy. A collaborative project performed between the author and the Albany Institute of History and Art (AIHA) in Albany, New York, in November 1988, involved the plain film and CT analysis of two ancient human Egyptian mummies. Both mummies have been part of AIHA\u2019s Egyptian collection since their purchase from the Cairo Museum in 1909.

The dis- tal portion of the prosthesis has a CT density measurement of \u2013600 Hounsfield units, which is that of air. This is probably some low-density air-filled shell that looks like a toe. The more proximal socketlike portion, which holds the toe, mea- sures +1,318 Hounsfield units. This is very high-density material, but it does not appear to be metal on X ray. It may be some form of high-density ceramic, which exactly fits the \u201ctoe\u201d and rests upon the first metatarsal bone of the foot. This prosthesis has only been visualized with X ray and CT because the female mummy has never been unwrapped from her burial cloth. The reason for the artificial toe stems from the ancient Egyptian belief that one should enter the hereafter \u201cwhole.\u201d A recent report in the British medical journal  describes a wooden prosthesis of the great right toe of a female mummy from the 21st or 22nd dynasty (ca. 1065\u2013740 B . C . E .), which is the same time period as the AIHA mummy. The amputation site was covered with skin, indicating that it was an intravital (during life) amputation. This prosthesis was composed of three separate components. The main compo- nent consisted of a perfectly shaped wooden corpus (12  \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm), which resembled a big toe including the nail. This was attached to two small wooden plates that were fixed to each other by seven leather strings. According to the authors, there were clear marks of use on the sole of the prosthetic toe, indicating that it had been used during life. In early 1989 a collaborative study was performed between the AIHA, the author, and William Lorensen, Ph.D., of the General Electric Corporate Research & Development in Schenectady, New York. The CT data obtained from the November 1988 mummy studies was used to perform the first-ever computer-assisted \u201cunwrapping\u201d of a mummy. Using a proprietary surface-algorithm program developed by Dr. Lorensen, the mummy\u2019s facial linen was removed in a computer program capable of sensing differences in sur- face shading. (The original study is in the archives of GE Corporate Research & Development.) When multiple images from this study are viewed in cin\u00e9 mode, there is clearly the visual impression that the linens are actually being removed. Computed tomography (CT) shows the prosthesis on a  mummy\u2019s foot. The prosthesis is composed of a high-density  U-shaped holder and a low-density \u201ctoe.\u201d The mummy has  never been unwrapped, and only X ray and CT have   provided images of one of the most carefully constructed  toe prostheses ever seen.

He entered a local medical school, where he studied for three years and then began working in Paris hospitals. He received his M.D. degree in 1893 and returned to Rouen, becoming director of the bacteriological lab- oratory in 1896. He left in 1903 to become director of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, a position he held until his death in 1936. Early in his career, Nicolle worked on cancer, and at Rouen he investigated the preparation of diphtheria antiserum. In North Africa, under his influence, the Institute at Tunis quickly became a world-famous cen- ter for bacteriological research and for the production of vaccines and serums to combat most of the prevalent infectious diseases. He discovered in 1909 that the body louse trans- mits "

The chemical shift, \u03b4, of a nucleus is expressed in parts per million (ppm) by its frequency, \u03bd n , relative to a standard, \u03bd ref , and defined as \u03b4 = 10 6 (\u03bd n \u2013 \u03bd ref )/\u03bd o , where \u03bd o is the operat- ing frequency of the spectrometer.

He was educated first at the church school in Ryazan, the Ryazan Ecclesiastical High School, and then at the local theological seminary. Pavlov abandoned religion for science when he was inspired by the progressive ideas of the Russian literary critic D. I. Pisarev, by Ivan M. Sechenov, the father of Russian "
    ], 
    "physiology": [
        ", and by the works of Charles Darwin. In 1870 he enrolled in the physics and mathematics faculty to take the course in natural science. Pavlov became interested in physiology. While tak- ing the course in natural science, he and a fellow stu- dent wrote a treatise on the physiology of the pancreatic nerves that won wide acclaim, and Pavlov was awarded a gold medal. In 1875 Pavlov received the degree of candidate of natural sciences. However, his overwhelming interest in physiology forced him to continue his studies and attend the Academy of Medical Surgery. Pavlov won a fellowship at the academy, and with a position as direc- tor of the physiological laboratory at the clinic of the famous Russian clinician, S. P. Botkin, he was able to continue his research work. In 1881 Pavlov married Seraphima (Sara) Vasilievna Karchevskaya, a teacher, the daughter of a doctor. They had four sons and a daughter. In 1883 he presented his thesis, entitled \u201cThe centrifugal nerves of the heart,\u201d and laid down the basic principles on the trophic function of the nervous system. Pavlov showed that there existed a basic pat- tern in the reflex regulation of the activity of the circu- latory organs. In 1890 Pavlov organized and directed the depart- ment of physiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and spent the next 45 years making it one of the most important centers of physiological research. Also, in 1890 he was appointed professor of pharma- cology at the Military Medical Academy, and five years later he was appointed to the then-vacant chair of physiology, which he held until 1925. Between the years 1891 and 1900, Pavlov did the bulk of his research on the physiology of diges- tion at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and demonstrated that the nervous system played the dominant part in regulating the "
    ], 
    "digestive process": [
        ". Pavlov promoted his research in lectures that he delivered in 1895 and published under the title  sii o rabote glavnykh pishchevaritelnyteh zhelez  (Lectures on the function of the principal digestive glands) in 1897. His research on the physiology of digestion led to the development of the first experimental model of learning, called classical conditioning. Pavlov\u2019s research into the physiology of digestion led to the study of con- ditioned reflexes. In a now-classic experiment, he trained a hungry dog to salivate at the sound of a bell, which was previously associated with the sight of food. He implanted small stomach pouches in dogs to mea- sure the secretion of gastric juices produced when the dogs began to eat. In 1901 he was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and in 1904 he was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in digestion. In 1907 he was elected academician of the Russian Acade- my of Sciences, and in 1912 he was given an honorary doctorate at Cambridge University. He held many other honorary memberships of various scientific societies abroad. Finally, upon the recommendation of the Med- ical Academy of Paris, he was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor (1915). After the Russian Revolution, a special government decree signed by Lenin on January 24, 1921, noted \u201cthe outstanding scientific services of Academician I. P. Pavlov, which are of enormous significance to the working class of the whole world.\u201d The Communist Party and the Soviet government gave Pavlov and his collaborators unlimited scope for scientific research and built him a laboratory.

Radioactive elements tend to concentrate in human-made artifacts, igneous rocks, the continental crust, and so the technique is not very useful for sedimentary rocks, although in some cases, when certain elements are found, it is possible to date them using this technique. Other radiometric dat- ing techniques used are:  Electrons become trapped in the crystal lattice of min- erals from adjacent radioactive material and alter the magnetic field of the mineral at a known rate. This nondestructive technique is used for dating bone and shell, since exposure to magnetic fields does not destroy the material (e.g., carbonates [calcium] in lime- stone, coral, egg shells, and teeth).  This technique is used for dating glassy material like obsidian or any artifacts that contain uranium-bear- ing material, such as natural or human-made glass, ceramics, or stones that were used in hearths for food preparation. Narrow fission tracks from the release of high-energy charged alpha particles burn into the material as a result of the decay of uranium 238 to lead 206 (half-life of 4.47 billion years) or induced by the irradiation of uranium 235 to lead 207 (half-life of 704 million years). The number of tracks is pro- portional to the time since the material cooled from its original molten condition, i.e., fission tracks are created at a constant rate throughout time, so it is possible to determine the amount of time that has passed since the track accumulation began from the number of tracks present. This technique is good for dates from 20 million to 1 billion years ago. U-238 fission track techniques are from spontaneous fission, and induced-fission tracking from U-235 is a tech- nique involving controlled irradiation of the artifact with thermal neutrons of U-235. Both techniques give a thermal age for the material in question. The spon- taneous fission of uranium-238 was first discovered by the Russian scientists K. A. Petrzhak and G. N. Flerov in 1940.  This method has been used to date rocks as old as  4 billion years and is a popular dating technique for archeological material.

        "  (rate-determining step; rate-  limiting step)  A rate-controlling step in a reaction occurring by a composite mechanism is an elementary reaction, the rate constant for which exerts a dominant effect\u2014stronger than that of any other rate constant\u2014 on the overall rate. R\u00e9aumur, Ren\u00e9-Antoine Ferchault de  (1683\u20131757) French  Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur was born in La Rochelle, France, in 1683. After studying mathematics in Bourges he moved to Paris in 1703 at age 20 and under the eye of a relative. Like most scien- tists of the time, he made contributions in a number of areas, including meteorology. His work in mathematics allowed him entrance to the Academy of Sciences in 1708. Two years later, he was put in charge of compil- ing a description of the industrial and natural resources in France, and as a result he developed a broad-based view of the sciences. It also inspired him to invention, which led him into the annals of weather and climate and, ultimately, the invention of a thermometer and temperature scale. In 1713 R\u00e9aumur made spun-glass fibers that were made of the same material as today\u2019s building blocks of Ethernet networking and fiber-optic cable. A few years later, in 1719, after observing wasps building nests, he suggested that paper could be made from wood in response to a critical shortage of papermaking materials (rags) at the time. He also was impressed by the geomet- rical perfection of the beehive\u2019s hexagonal cells and pro- posed that they be used as a unit of measurement. He turned his interests from industrial resources such as steel to temperature, and in 1730 he presented to the Paris Academy his study \u201cA Guide for the Produc- tion of Thermometers with Comparable Scales.\u201d He wanted to improve the reliability of "

However, most of Europe, with the exception of the British Isles and Scandinavia, adopted his thermometer and scale. Unfortunately, his errors in the way he fixed his points were criticized by many in the scientific communi- ty at the time, and even with modifications in the scale, instrument makers favored making mercury-based ther- mometers. R\u00e9aumur\u2019s scale, however, lasted over a cen- tury, and in some places well into the late 20th century. Between 1734 and 1742, R\u00e9aumur wrote six vol- umes of  (Memoirs serving as a natural history of insects). Although unfinished, this work was an important con- tribution to entomology.

Each smooth muscle cell contains thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments that slide against each other to produce contraction of the cell and are anchored near the plasma membrane. Smooth muscle contraction is slower than that of striated muscle and can be sus- tained for long periods of time. Smooth muscle can be found in blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, bronchi of the lungs, the bladder, and the uterus. Smooth muscle is primarily under the control of the autonomic nervous system. "

In 1891 he entered the University of Heidelberg after spending his military service from 1889 to 1890. He studied at the University of Munich during the win- ter of 1893\u201394, and from the spring of 1894 to the end of 1908 he worked in the Zoological Institute at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. In 1895 he took his Ph.D. degree in zoology, botany, and physics, and three years later was qualified as a lecturer in zoology at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. In 1908 he was asked to become professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at Rostock, and in 1914 he became associate director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti- tute of Biology at Berlin-Dahlem. In 1919 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Freiburg-im-Breisgau, a post that he held until he retired in 1935, then becoming emeritus professor.

He received a B.S. from Washburn College in 1937 and an M.D. from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in 1942. Sutherland joined the faculty of Washington Uni- versity, and in 1953 he became director of the depart- ment of medicine at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Here he discovered cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate) in 1956. In 1963 he became professor of physiology at Van- derbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for isolation of cyclic adenosine monophos- phate (cyclic AMP) and for demonstrating its involve- ment in numerous animal metabolic processes. From 1973 until his death he was a member of the faculty of the University of Miami Medical School. He died on March 9, 1974, in Miami, Florida.

Both types receive lots of rain, with the tropical rain forest obtaining 400 inches a year, while the temperate rain forest receives about 100 inches per year. Tropical rain forests are warm and moist, but temperate rain forests are cool. Tropical rain forests lie between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn and receive rainfall regularly throughout the year (80\u2013400 inches per year) and are warm and frost free all year long (mean temperatures are between 70 and 85\u00b0F), with very little daily fluctua- tion. Tropical rain forests are found in Latin America (57 percent), while one-third of the world\u2019s tropical rain forests are in Brazil. Some 25 percent of the tropical rain forests can be found in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, and 18 percent are found in West Africa. Smaller temperate rain forests can be found on the southeast coast of Chile in South America and a few other coastal strips, including small areas in the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, New Zealand, and southern Australia. Half of the world\u2019s plant and animal species live in the tropical rain forests, even though they comprise only 20 percent of all forests.
