# PubData

## About

PubData is a user-friendly search engine for all bioinformatics databases worldwide.  PubData is to FTP data, as PubMed is to online publications. 

PubData is designed as a graphical user interface (GUI) software program written in the Python programming language and PySide (Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt).  PubData can remotely search, access, view, and download files from the deeply nested directory trees of any major bioinformatics database via a local computer network.  

By assembling all major bioinformatics databases under the roof of one software program, PubData allows the user to avoid the unnecessary hassle and non-standardized complexities inherent to accessing databases one-by-one using an Internet browser.  More importantly, it allows a user to query multiple databases simultaneously for user-specified keywords (e.g., `human`, `cancer`, `transcriptome`).  As such, PubData allows researchers to search, access, view, and download files from the FTP servers of any major bioinformatics database directly from one centralized location.  By using only a GUI, PubData allows the user to simultaneously surf multiple bioinformatics FTP servers directly from the comfort of their local computer.  PubData is designed with network programming and natural language processing algorithms that can patch into any user-specified bioinformatics online database.

PubData is an ongoing bioinformatics software project financially supported by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program. This research was conducted with Government support under and awarded by DoD, Army Research Office (ARO), National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, 32 CFR 168a.
