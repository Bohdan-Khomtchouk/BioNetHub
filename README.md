# BioNetHub

## About

BioNetHub is a software program written in the Python programming language that can remotely access and navigate through the directory tree of any major bioinformatics database via a local computer network.

By assembling all major bioinformatics databases under the roof of one software program, BioNetHub allows the user to avoid the unnecessary hassle and non-standardized complexities inherent to accessing databases one-by-one using an Internet browser. As such, BioNetHub allows researchers to access, view, and download files from the FTP servers of any major bioinformatics database directly from one centralized location. By using only a command-line environment (e.g., Terminal), BioNetHub allows the user to simultaneously surf multiple bioinformatics FTP servers directly from the comfort of their local computer. BioNetHub is designed with network programming algorithms that can patch into any user-specified bioinformatics online database to be able to navigate, view, and download files directly from the command-line from one centralized location on a local computer network.

BioNetHub is an ongoing bioinformatics software project fully financially supported by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program. This research was conducted with Government support under and awarded by DoD, Army Research Office (ARO), National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, 32 CFR 168a.
